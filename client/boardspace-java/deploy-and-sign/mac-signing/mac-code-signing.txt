Mac app signing

Add an item to the login keychain corresponding to the mac code signing certificate
login to develop.apple.com, create a macos certificate, 
on the mac, in applications/utilities/keychain access get the cert to show up there.




use the signing tool to sign the jars

	codesign -s "3rd party" ../Tantrix.jar 
	codesign -s "3rd party" ../boardspace.jar

use jar2app.py to construct the .app

	./jar2app boardspace.jar -i boardspace.icns 
	./jar2app Tantrix.jar -i tantrix.icns 

sign the interior elements in the jars

	codesign -s "3rd party" boardspace.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaAppLauncher 
	codesign -s "3rd party" boardspace.app/Contents/Resources/boardspace.icns 
	codesign -s "3rd party" boardspace.app

	codesign -s "3rd party" Tantrix.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaAppLauncher 
	codesign -s "3rd party" Tantrix.app/Contents/Resources/boardspace.icns 
	codesign -s "3rd party" Tantrix.app

these steps are contained in jar2app-master/build.csh
then use "diskutility" to package them as dmgs
