The original deployment used Jar2App to create a mac application bundle.  This works
well enough, but doesn't include a JVM, and isn't acceptable to the mac app store.
see build.csh


Using universalMacApplicationLauncher, it can be bundled with a JVM, but
still not acceptable to the app store because the script can't be signed.
I tested this by using the jar2app option to bundle a jvm (which no longer
works) and substituting the universal launcher for the javaapplauncher
in the package.  This works, but isn't acceptable to the app store
due to signing issues.  Theoretically this could be fixed by writing
a new native app that trampolined to the universal script, or some
similar work around.

using jpackage is promising, maybe eventually will be a 1 stop tool,
but right now doesn't fully configure the info.plist, and has signing
issues.  

The three step process in 

jbuild.csh <version>

manually edit info.plist to fix application type
and version number.

./jsign.csh
signs and forcibly resignes a lot of stuff
and the result goes to the app store.
