	 * reasonable limits, and which has the main "board" object at the left.
	 * <p>
	 *  The basic layout technique used here is to start with a cell which is about the size
	 *  of a board square, and lay out all the other objects relative to the board or to one
	 *  another.  The rectangles don't all have to be on grid points, and don't have to
	 *  be non-overlapping, just so long as the result generally looks good.

	 *  with the "addRect" mechanism to help visualize the layout.

 * synchronization where it is really needed.
 * <p>
 * This toolkit addresses this problem by adopting the "one thread" model,
 * and this is where it is.  Any other threads should do as little as possible,
 * mainly leave breadcrumbs that will be picked up by this thread.
 * <p>
 * In particular:
 * GUI events do not respond in the native thread.  Mouse movement and button
 * events are noted for later.  Requests to repaint the canvas are recorded but
 * not acted upon.
 * Network I/O events, merely queue the data for delivery later.
