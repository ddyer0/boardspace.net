<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b><i>Background</i></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; In ancient 
Greek mythology there was a sea god named Proteus. His most notable 
characteristic was that he could change his shape at will, from a man to
 a fish, a whale, a bird, or anything else. This most useful skill 
against opponents gave rise to the expression of being in a "Protean 
struggle." The Proteus game set is so named because the game can change 
its form — not its physical form, but rather the game rules themselves.
</p></blockquote>
<br><br>&nbsp;<br>

<font size="5"><b>How to play PROTEUS<font size="2"><sup>®</sup></font></b></font>
<ul>
<li>  <i>Players:</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Two. 
</li><li> <i>Object:</i>   &nbsp; &nbsp; Attain the Goal in effect at the end of the turn.
</li><li> <i>Equipment:</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp;  The Proteus board; 3 pieces per player; 9 engraved tiles.

</li></ul>

<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="3" width="50%">

<p><font size="4"><b>The rule tiles:</b></font>
</p><p>The 9 tiles have markings on their face only. The backs are 
blank. There are 3 tiles in each of three colors. During the game, only 
one tile of each color may be face up (active) at a time. Here's what 
the inscriptions mean:

</p><p><br><b>MOVE</b> (maroon tiles)<br>
Proteus pieces move like certain chess figures, with these exceptions: —
 a piece, except when moving as a king, may leap over another piece if 
there is an empty space on the other side of the piece being jumped 
over; there is no capturing. Active MOVE rules apply equally to all 
pieces. Only one piece allowed per space.
</p><ul>
<li>KING — moves like a chess king, one space in any direction. 

</li><li>ROOK — moves like a chess rook, any distance in the same row or column (horizontal or vertical). 

</li><li>BISHOP/KNIGHT — moves to any empty space <i>not</i> in the same row or column. 
</li></ul><br>


<p><b>TRADE</b> (turquoise tiles)<br>
Two tiles may exchange places.  Their relative positions don’t matter, 
nor whether they are face-up or face-down.  Pieces, if any occupy them, 
stay put to await the new tile. Only one tile allowed per space. There 
are 27 different tile pair combinations for each of these:
</p><ul>
<li> POLARITY — both tiles to be traded must contain pieces, and the 
pieces must belong to opposing players. The symbols on the pieces don't 
matter.

</li><li> COLOR  — both tiles to be traded must be the same color. The color doesn't matter, and they need not be occupied.

</li><li> SHAPE  — both tiles to be traded must be the same shape. The shape doesn't matter, and they need not be occupied.
</li></ul><br>


<p><b>GOAL</b> (gold tiles)<br> 
These tiles represent the three different ways a game can be won. The 
first method is just like Tic-Tac-Toe. The other two methods require 
that a player's 3 pieces occupy similar tiles, regardless of their 
relative positions on the board. 
</p><ul>
<li>3-IN-LINE  — The winning player's three pieces must be in a straight line, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

</li><li>COLOR — the player's three pieces must occupy tiles of a single color; symbols on pieces need not match the tiles.

</li><li>SHAPE  — the player's three pieces must occupy tiles of the same shape. 
</li></ul>

<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="3" width="50%">

<p><font size="4"><b>Placement Phase</b></font>

</p><p>The board begins empty, with the 9 tiles spread around for easy selection in a common pool. Black places first. 

 
</p><p>Players take turns placing any of the tiles from the pool 
face-down onto any empty space of the board, or placing one of their own
 pieces onto any space already occupied by a vacant tile (never onto an 
empty space). Once placed, no piece or tile can be moved during this 
phase of the game. 

</p><p>When a piece and a tile of the same shape come together, that 
tile is turned face-up and becomes active. Its rule will stay in effect 
until another tile of the same color is activated.

</p><p>During the 15 turns of the placement phase, one and only one tile
 of each color must be activated. They may be activated in any order and
 by either player. Once a tile is activated, no other tile of the same 
color can accept a piece of matching shape until after all tiles and 
pieces have been placed. 

</p><p>Plan ahead: &nbsp;it may happen that only one player can activate
 a tile and therefore must do so.  For example, if two of the three 
tiles of a color are already occupied by non-matching pieces, only the 
third tile is still open for activation. If only one player has a piece 
of the requisite shape to activate that tile, that is a mandatory 
placement for that player.</p><p>


</p><hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="3" width="50%">


<p><font size="4"><b>Movement Phase</b></font> 
</p><p>The movement phase begins when all the pieces and tiles are on 
the board and three tiles of different colors are active (provided the 
game was not already won during the placement phase).
 
</p><p>Players take turns moving any one of their own pieces to a vacant
 tile (according to the active Move rule), or exchanging two tiles 
(according to the active Trade rule). 

</p><p>When, through a move or trade, a piece and tile of the same shape
 are brought together, that tile becomes activated. It is turned 
face-up, and the previously active tile of the same color is turned 
face-down. The new rule is now in effect for both players. If a trade of
 two inactive tiles of the same color produces two matches, they cancel 
each other and the previously active tile stays in effect. 
 
</p><p>The first player to satisfy the Goal active <i>at the end of that turn</i> is the winner. If both players simultaneously meet the goal, neither wins and the game continues until there is a clear winner.
