/**
 * 
 * This is intended to be maintained as the reference example how to interface to boardspace.
 * <p>
 * The overall structure here is a collection of classes specific to Hex, which extend
 * or use supporting online.game.* classes shared with the rest of the site.  The top level 
 * class is a Canvas which implements ViewerProtocol, which is created by the game manager.  
 * The game manager has very limited communication with this viewer class, but manages
 * all the error handling, communication, scoring, and general chatter necessary to make
 * the game part of the site.
 * <p>
 * The main classes are:
 * <br>GameViewer - this class, a canvas for display and mouse handling
 * <br>GameBoard - board representation and implementation of the game logic
 * <br>GameMovespec - representation, parsing and printing of move specifiers
 * <br>GamePlay - a robot to play the game
 * <br>GameConstants - static constants shared by all of the above.  
 *  <p>
 *  The primary purpose of the PushfightViewer class is to do the actual
 *  drawing and to mediate the mouse gestures.  All the actual work is 
 *  done in an event loop, rather than in direct response to mouse or
 *  window events, so there is only one process involved.  With a single 
 *  process, there are no worries about synchronization among processes
 *  of lack of synchronization - both major causes of flakey user interfaces.
 *  <p>
 *  The actual mouse handling is done by the commonCanvas class, which simply 
 *  records the recent mouse activity, and triggers "MouseMotion" to be called
 *  while the main loop is executing.
 *  <p>
 *  Similarly, the actual "update" and "paint" methods for the canvas are handled
 *  by commonCanvas, which merely notes that a paint is needed and returns immediately.
 *  drawCanvas is called in the event loop.
 *  <p>
 *  The drawing methods here combine mouse handling and drawing in a slightly
 *  nonstandard way.  Most of the drawing routines also accept a "HitPoint" object
 *  which contains the coordinates of the mouse.   As objects are drawn, we notice
 *  if the current object contains the mouse point, and if so deposit a code for 
 *  the current object in the HitPoint.  the Graphics object for drawing can be null,
 *  in which case no drawing is actually done, but the mouse sensitivity is checked
 *  anyway.  This method of combining drawing with mouse sensitivity helps keep the
 *  mouse sensitivity accurate, because it is always in agreement with what is being
 *  drawn.
 *  <p>
 *  Steps to clone this hierarchy to start the next game
 *  <li> use eclipse refactor to rename the package and individual files
 *  <li> duplicate the game start configuration, making a new one for the new game
 *  <li> launch the new game and get it to start, still identical to the old pushfight in all but name.
 *  	this will probably require a few edits to the init code.
 *  <li> do a cvs update on the original pushfight hierarchy to get back the original code.
 *

 * <p>
 * In particular:

     *****		 Simultaneous moves support *****
     * 
     * Games where all the players move at the same time cause a lot of problems, but
     * it's the right thing to do in some cases.  The current games that use at least
     * some simultaneous moves are:
     *  Euphoria, Magnet, Raj, One Day In London, Q.E., Breaking Away, Tammany Hall, and Imagine
     * 
     * The root of the problem is that players WILL disagree about the order of arrival of 
     * asynchronous moves. This causes their game records to be different from one another,
     * and causes the server's incremental bookkeeping of the game state to be seen as
     * inconsistent.
     * 
     * The overall strategy for dealing with his problem is to segregate the simultaneous
     * moves to the end of the game record, and anchor the server's record of the game at
     * the beginning of the ephemeral block.   At appropriate points, the ephemeral moves
     * are replaced in the game record by equivalent non-ephemeral moves in canonical order.
     * 
     * 
     * Another problem is time accounting - while in simultaneous mode, the clocks for all 
     * the players who have not completed their move should tick.
     * 
     * Tendrils to support this are all over the place, which made support difficult; but
     * the most common solutions are embodied in requirements for move specs, states, and
     * in overridable methods of commonCanvas 
     * 
     * the xxMovespec class will use pairs of ephemeral/normal moves, and implement
     * and board states which allow asynchronous moves will be distinct from the states
     * that do not.
     *
