/**
 * 
 * Overall Architecture
 * 
 * The site provides the lobby, choice game and opponents, communication between the players, information 
 * for spectators,  rankings, and a host of other services.  Each game has to be concerned only with 
 * the game itself.   An individual game (say, Hex) is launched and each client independantly initializes
 * itself to a common starting state.   Thereafter each player specifies messages to be broadcast to the
 * other participants, and receives messages being broadcast by the other participants, which keep everyone
 * informed about the state of the game.  There is no common "true" state of the game - all the participants
 * keep in step by virtue of seeing the same stream of messages.    Messages are mostly simple "pick up a stone"
 * "place a stone on space x" and so on.
 * 
 * The things a game must implement are specified by the class "ViewerProtocol", and a game could just
 * start there and be implemented completely from scratch, but in practice there is another huge pile
 * of things that every game has to do; dealing with graphis, mouse events, saving and restoring the
 * game state from static records, replaying and reviewing games and so on.   These are implemented in the 
 * class "commonCanvas" and by several board-like base classes for Hex and Square geometry boards.   
 * All the existing games for boardspace use these classes to provide graphics and basic board representation.
 * 
 * For games with robot players, there is another huge pile of things that a robot has to do, generating
 * moves, evaluating and choosing the best, and implementing a lookahead several moves deep.   There's a
 * standard framework for this using the "RobotProtocol" class and the "SearchDriver" class.
