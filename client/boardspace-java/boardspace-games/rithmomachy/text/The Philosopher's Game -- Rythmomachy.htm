<h1>The Philosopher's Game</h1>

<p>This file is a transcription of a 1563 translation by William
Fulke (or Fulwood -- the sources disagree) of Boissiere's 1554/56
description of Rythmomachy. It is entry 15542a in the Short Title
Catalog of Pollard and Redgrave, and on Reel 806 of the corresponding
microfilm collection.</p>

<p>Annotation will occur occasionally throughout; they will appear in
square brackets and italics, <i>[like this]</i>. Spelling will be
erratic; I'm transcribing quickly, so I will often be modernizing the
spelling, but will leave original spelling whenever I consider there
to be doubt about the meaning. I also will sometimes modernize the
punctuation and paragraph breaks in the interests of readability.
This is <em>not</em> intended to serve as a definitive critical
edition, merely a working copy, good enough to understand the
game.</p>

<p>My thanks to Peter Mebben, who pointed me in the direction of this
source, and provided the first draft of the dedication.</p>

<p>Sith that your honour is full bent,<br>
(right honorable lord)<br>
To wisdom &amp; to godlines<br>
with true faithful accord.</p>

<p>Sith that in deed you do delyte,<br>
in learning and in skyll:<br>
The show wherof doth well expresse<br>
a perfect godly wyll.</p>

<p>Sith that also you have in hand,<br>
affayres of force and waight:<br>
And study do both day and night,<br>
to set all thinges full straight.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>I thought therfore your honour should<br>
not lacke some godly game:<br>
Whereby you might at vacant times<br>
your self to pastyme frame.</p>

<p>Whereby I say you might release,<br>
such travailes from your mynde:<br>
And in the meane while honest mirth<br>
and prudent pastyme fynde.</p>

<p>Remembring then this auncient play,<br>
where wisdome doth abound:<br>
Called the Philosophers game,<br>
me thinkth I have one found.</p>

<p>Which may your honour recreate,<br>
to read and exercise:<br>
And which to you I here submit,<br>
in rude and homly wise.</p>

<p>Pithagoras did first invent,<br>
this play as it is thought:<br>
And therby after studies great,<br>
his receation sought.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>Yea therby he would well refreshe,<br>
his studious wery braine:<br>
And still in knowledge further wade<br>
and plye it to his gaine.</p>

<p>Accompting that a wicked play,<br>
wherin a man leudely:<br>
Mispendes his tyme &amp; wit also,<br>
and no good getts thereby.</p>

<p>But grevously offendes the Lord,<br>
and so in steed of rest:<br>
With trouble and vexation great,<br>
on every side is prest.</p>

<p>Most games and playes abused are,<br>
and fewe do now remaine:<br>
In good and godly order as,<br>
they ought to be certaine.</p>

<p>For why? all games should recreat,<br>
the hevy mynde of man:<br>
And eke the body overlayde:<br>
with cares and troubles than.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>But now in stead of pleasant mirth,<br>
great passions do arise:<br>
In stead of recreation now,<br>
revengings we practise.</p>

<p>In stead of love and amitie,<br>
long discords do appeare:<br>
In stead of trueth and quietnes,<br>
great othes and lyes we heare.</p>

<p>In stead frendship, falshode now,<br>
mixed with cruell hate:<br>
We finde to be in playes &amp; games,<br>
which dayly cause debate.</p>

<p>Pithagoras therfor I saye,<br>
to make redresse herein:<br>
Invented first this godly game,<br>
therby to flye from sinne.</p>

<p>Since which time it continued hath,<br>
in Frenche &amp; Latin eke:<br>
Still exercisde with learned men,<br>
their comforts so to seeke.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>Wherby without a further prose,<br>
all men may be right sure:<br>
That this game unto gravitie,<br>
and wisdome doth allure.</p>

<p>Els would not that Philosopher,<br>
Pithagoras so wyse:<br>
Have laboured with diligence,<br>
this pastime to devyse.</p>

<p>Els would not so well learned men,<br>
have amplified the same:<br>
From tyme to tyme with travell great,<br>
to bring it into fame.</p>

<p>But let us nerer now proceed,<br>
and come we to theffect:<br>
And then shall we assuredly,<br>
this pastime not neglect.</p>

<p>For it with pleasure doth asswage,<br>
the heavy troubled hart:<br>
And with lyke comforts drives away,<br>
all kynde of sourging smart.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>The mynde it maketh circumspect,<br>
and heedfull for to bee;<br>
The tyme that theron is bestowd,<br>
is not in vaine trulye.</p>

<p>The body it doth styrre and move,<br>
to lightsomnes and ioye:<br>
The sences and the powers all,<br>

<p>It practiseth Arithmeticke,<br>
and use of number showth:<br>
As he that is conning therein,<br>
assuredly well knowth.</p>

<p>In Geometie it truly wades,<br>
and therein hath to do:<br>
A learned play it is doutlesse,<br>

<p>Proportion also musicall,<br>

<p>What game therfore lyke unto this,<br>
may gotten be or had?<br>
There is not one that I do know,<br>
the rest are all to bad.</p>

<p>It causeth no contention this,<br>
nor no debate at all,<br>
By this no hatred wrath nor guyle,<br>
in any wise doth fall.</p>

<p>It stirreth not such troubles that,<br>
our frend becomes our foe:<br>
It moveth not to mischiefe this,<br>
as many others do.</p>

<p>Let us avoyde the worst therfore,<br>
and cleve we to the best.<br>
So shall we shunne all wickednes,<br>
and purchase quiet rest.</p>

<p>So shall we serve the living Lorde,<br>
and walke after his will:<br>
So shall we do the thing is good,<br>
and flye that which is yll.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>So shall we live right christianlyke,<br>
and do our duties well:<br>
So shall we please both god &amp; prince,<br>
none shall us need compell.</p>

<p>And then the Lord of his mercie,<br>
will prosper us alwayes:<br>
And graunt us here to have on earth,<br>
full many godly dayes.</p>

<p>Yea then the Lord of his goodnes,<br>

<h1>To the Reader.</h1>

<p>I Dout not but some man of severe judgement so soone as
he hath one read the title of this boke wyl immediately sai,
that I had more need to exhort men to worke, then to teach them
to play, which censure if it procede not of such a froward
morositie that can be content with nothing but that he doth
himself, I do not only well admit, but also willingly submit my
self therto. And if I could be persuaded that men at mine
exhortation wold be more diligent to labour, I would not only
write a treatise twise as long as this, but also thynke my
whole time wel bestowed, if I</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>did nothing els, but invent, speake, and write that which might
exhort, move, &amp; persuade them to the furtherance of the same. But
if after honest labour and travell recreation be requisit, (and that
nede no further probation because we favour the cause wel inough) I
had rather teach men so to play, as both honestye may be reserved, their
wittes exercised, they them selves refreshed, and some profit also
attayned, then for lacke of exercise to see them either passe the
tyme in idlenes, or els to have pleasure in thyngs fruitles and
uncomely. And if great Emperours and mighty Monarches of the world
have not bene ashamed by writing bookes to teaches the art of Dyce</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>playing, of all good men abhorred, and by all good lawes condemned:
have I not some colour of defence, to teache the game, which so wyse
men have invented, so learned men frequented, and no good man hath
ever condemned.</p>

<p>The invention is ascribed to Pythagoras, it beareth the name of
Philosophers, prudent men do practise it &amp; godly men do praise it.
But because many herein (as in a play) have challenged much authoritie,
they have filled this game with much diversitie. In which as I could
perceive the most differens of playing to consist in thre kindes, so
have I playnly and briefly set them forth in Englishe not as though
there might not more diversities be espied, but</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>that I thought these to them whom I have written to be sufficient.
yet for that I woulde be lothe, from playe &amp; game, to fall to earnest
contention, if any man in this doing or any part thereof shall think
I have done amisse, and will do better himself, so far am I from
envying his good proceding, that I wil be right glad, and geve him
heartye thankes therefore.</p>

<p>All things belonging to this game<br>
for reason you may bye:<br>

<h1>The bookes verdicte.</h1>

<p>Wanting I have bene long truly,<br>
In english language many a day:<br>
Lo yet at last now here am I,<br>
Your labours great for to delay,<br>
And pleasant pastime you to showe,<br>
Mynding your wits to move I trowe.</p>

<p>For though to mirth I do provoke,<br>
Unto Wisdome yet move I more:<br>
Laying on them a pleasant yoke,<br>
Wisdom I meane, which is the dore,<br>
Of all good things and commendable:<br>
Dout this I thinke no man is able:</p>

<p>Interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis:<br>
Yt possis animo quemuis sufferre laborem.</p>

<h1>The diffinition</h1>

<p>That moste auncient and learned playe, called the
Philosophers game, beinge in Greeke termed
<i>[...]</i>, is as much to saye in Englishe, as the battell
of numbers. Numbers be either even or odde, wherefore the even
parte is against the odde, either parte havinge a kyng, whych
being taken of the adversaryes part, and a triumphe celebrated
within his campe, the game is ended.</p>

<h2>Of diverse kyndes of playinge.</h2>

<p>Amonge the dyverse kyndes of playing thys game, we shall sette
forth three sortes, of which the reader maye chose whether of them
he lyketh beste. And of all those three, we shall</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>gyve suche shorte and easye rules, that no man (althoughe he were
altogether ignoraunt in Arithmetike) shall fynde the game so hard, but
that he may learne to playe it.</p>

<h2>Of the partes of thys Game.</h2>

<p>He that wyll learne thys game, any of the three waies, muste first be
enstructed of these sixe partes.</p>

<ul>
<li>The table as the fielde
</li><li>.2. the menne and the numbers of them as the hoste
</li><li>.3. the placynge of them, as the encampynge
</li><li>.4. the order of playe and removynge the men, as the marchynge
    and fyghtynge
</li><li>.5. the manner and lawes of conqueryng and taking
</li><li>.6. and last of al the triumphe after the victorye.
</li></ul>

<h2>Of these partes in the fyrst kynd of playng.</h2>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>The table muste be a playne borde conteynynge .128. squares that is
.8. in breadth and .16. in length sette forthe in two dyverse collours.
Or for a plainer understandynge, the table is a doble chesse bord, as it
were two chessebordes joyned together, the length of twoo, the breadth
of one, whereof thys is an example.</p>

<h2>Of the men.</h2>

<p>The men be in number .48. Wherof .24. be of one side &amp; must be
knowen by one colour, and .24. on the other syde, whyche also must
be marked with a contrarye colour, as White and Blacke, Blew and
Redde, or what colours els you lyke best. But in the colering
there .3. thinges must be observed, the bottome or lower part of
every man (excepte the two kinges) muste by marked wyth his adversaries
colour, that when he is taken, he maye chaunge his coate and serve
him unto whome he is prisoner.</p>

<p>The seconde thinge considered in the men, is their fashion: for of
euther syde .8. are rounds, other .8. are triangles &amp; .7. (the king
making .8.) are squares. There fashion is such <i>[small inset showing
roundes, triangles, squares]</i>.</p>

<p>The kynges because they consist of all three sortes, as it is
knowen by the learned speculation of the numbers, beare</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>the fashion of all thre kindes, his foundations are two squares, on
which are sette, two triangles &amp; upon them rounds. But this difference
is betwene the kinges, the king of the even numbers, hath a pointed
toppe, the king of the odde numbers is not pointed, the cause
dependeth upon the consideration of these numbers by which they arise
into piramidall fashion. The third thing considered in the men, is the
number that must be written or graven upon them which to learne
plainely for practise marke these short rules.</p>

<p>There be of eche kynde of men, two rankes or orders.</p>

<p>The first ranke or order of roundes be the digites even or odde
namely of the even .2.4.6.8. of the odde .3.5.7.9.</p>

<p>The second order of rounds are found by multiplyinge these digites
by themselves as .2. times .2. is .4.3. times .3. is .9. Of the even
they be .4.16.36.64. of the odde they be .9.25.49.81.</p>

<p>The first order of the triangles are found by addinge two of the
roundes together</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>one of the firste order and another of the seconde order, as
.2. and .4. make sixe .3. and .9. make twelve, on the even syde
they are these .6.20.42.72. on the odde syde .12.30.56.90.</p>

<p>The second order of triangles be made by addynge one to every
one of the first order of roundes, and then multiplying that
number in hym selfe: as .2. is one of the firste order of
roundes, thereto adde one, that is .3. then .3. tymes .3. is
.9. a triangle of the seconde order, on the even syde.
Likewise to thre a round on the odde side, adde .1. so it
is .4. then .4. tymes .4. is .16. On the even parte, they be
.9.25.49.81. on the odde parte .16.36.64.100.</p>

<p>The first order of squares (in whyche are contayned the
kynges) be made by addynge two triangles together, one of
the fyrste order, and another of the secondes, as .6. and
.9. make .15. likewyse .12. and .16. make .28. Amonge the even
they be .15.45. and .91. the kynge .153. amonge the odde they
be .28.66.120. and .190. the kynge.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>The last order of squares be found, by dobling of every one
of the firste order of roundes, and after adding one, last of
all be multiplying that number in itself, as twise .2. is .4.
and .1. added is .5. so .5. times .5. is .25. likewyse twyse .3.
is .6.1. added is .7. then .7. tymes .7. is .49. These be on
the even syde .25.81.169.289. And of the odde syde
.49.121.225.361.</p>

<p>These numbers must be sette uppon the men both on the upper
side, &amp; also on the nether side. Except one of the kynges,
which must with the whole number of their pyramid, be marked,
onely on the bottome. Because the sydes muste have other numbers,
namely the highest point of the even kyng, must have .1. the
rounde next under him marke with .4. the uppermost triangle
with .9. the nethermost with .16. The uppermost square muste
have .25. The nethermost square shall have .36. The king of
the odde upon his head, whiche is a rounde, not pointed hath
.16. upon his first triangle .25. on the second triangle
.36. uppon the fyrste square .49. upon the lowest square .64.</p>

<p><i>[The numbers in the next paragraph are in circles and
triangles, to illustrate.]</i></p>

<p>Finally it shalbe good for the avoydance of confusion, to
drawe a line under every number. Ells may you take one for
another, as 6 the even round &amp; 9 the odde rounde, may be
taken one for another with oute this lyne or some suche marke,
lykewise 6 and 9 Tryangles bothe of one syde. And this sufficient
for the men, the fashion, colours and numbers.</p>

<h2>The reason of these numbers and the knowledge of their
proportione.</h2>

<p>For them that seke the speculation of these numbers, rather then the
practise for playing, and have some sight in the sciens of Arithmetike,
some thyng must be sayde of proportion. For this purpose there be
three kyndes of proportion. Multiplex, superparticuler, and
superpartiens.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<h2>Of multiplex.</h2>

<p>MULTIPLEX proportion, is when a great number conteyneth a lesse
number manye tymes, and leaveth nothing, as .8. conteyneth .2.
fower tymes and nothing remaineth .16. conteyneth .4. &amp;, this
proportion semeth best to agree with roundes because the one
number conteyneth the other and nothynge remaineeth as the
fyrste order of roundes be.</p>

<p><i>[The following table shows the white (even) and black (odd)
rounds.]</i></p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>9</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<h2>The second order be these.</h2>

<p><i>[This table shows the first and second orders of rounds for
both sides.]</i></p>

<tr><td>9</td><td>25</td><td>49</td><td>81</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<h2>Of superparticuler proportion.</h2>

<p>Superparticuler proportion is when a greater number contayneth a
lesser with one part of it, which may measure the whole, as .12.
contayneth .9. and .3. whiche is a thyrde parte of nine .6.
contayneth .4. and .2. that is one halfe to .4. Thys proportion beinge
the cheife, next unto multiplex, is beste figured by a trianguler forme,
whyche hathe fewest lynes and angles next unto a circle. For the manner
of thys proportion consider thys figure.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p><i>[This table shows each base number above two rows of
triangles, and appears to be badly fouled up. I believe the
rows of base numbers are wrong -- the first set should be the
evens (2, 4, 6, 8), and the second the odds (3, 5, 7, 9).
That would make each Latin header match the number below it,
the first row of triangles would be the superparticulates
for that base number, and the second row would be the second
order of triangles for that base number, which is (x+1)<sup>2</sup>.]

<h2>Superpartiens proportion.</h2>

<p>The superpartiens proportion is when the greater number conteyneth
the lesser and mo partes of it then one as .15. conteyneth .9. and .6.
whiche is two thirdes of .9. lyke wyse .28. conteyneth .16. and .12.
that is 3/4 of .16. This proportion conteineth divers parts beside
the whole number therfore is wel figured in the square, which also

.9. of .3. laste .4. of .2. and single .1. all these added together

<h2>Of the marchinge or removing of the men.</h2>

<p>The battell beyng duely placed, it followeth next, to know
the maner of marching &amp; removing, for every kynd of men, hath
their proper kynde of motion, and fyrste we muste speake of the
roundes.</p>

<h2>The motyon of the roundes.</h2>

<p>The roundes muste move into the space that is next unto them
cornerwyse, as in the table, from the space .A. to any of these
.B.C.D. or .E.</p>

<p><i>[Yes, this is clearly saying that rounds only move diagonally.]
</i></p>

<h2>Of the triangles.</h2>

<p>The triangles passe three spaces counting that in which they
stande for one, and that into whych they do remove for another,
that is leaping over</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>one space. As from the space .A. he maye remove into any of
these space .F.G.H. or .I. this is the motion of the triangle
in marchying or takyng. But in flying he maye remove the
knyghtes draught of the chesse, as from .A. into .X. or
.W. &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Of the Squares.</h2>

<p>The Squares remove into the fourth place from them, that is
leaping over two, right forwarde or sydelong, as from the place
of .A. to any of these spaces .L.N.P.R. flyinge they maye
remove after the knyghts draught, but that they must passe
foure spaces, as from .P. to .Y. or .T. &amp;c. And this for the
marchinge and removyng of the men, where note, that with
theyr flying draughte they can take no man, but if needed by
helpe to besiege a man.</p>

<h2>Of the kynge marching.</h2>

<p>The kings because thei beare the forme of al the thre kynds,
may remove any</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>of all theyr draughts when they list, into the nexte with
the rounde, into the thyrde with the triangle, and into the
fourth with the square, and finally in all poyntes lyke the
Queene at the Chesse, saving that he can not passe above
foure spaces at the most.</p>

<h2>Of the maner of taking.</h2>

<p>The men may be taken sixe wayes, namely by Equalitie,
Oblivion, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and
Division, and also if you wyll, and so agree by</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td></td><td>/</td><td>Arithmeticall.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Proportion</td><td>&lt;</td><td>Geometricall.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>\</td><td>Musicall.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>Of Equalitie.</h2>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>By equality men may be taken, when one man after hys motion,
seeth hys enemye beyng of the same number that he is, standing
in such place as he may remove into, then maye he take awaye
hys enemye and not remove into hys place, as in this example
.9. a triangle of the even army, after he hath removed, espyeth
.9. a rounde of the odde armye, hym may he take up and not remove
into his place. But if .9. the triangle, espye nine the rounde,
before he remove, standing in his draught, he maye take hym up
and remove into his place.</p>

<p>These men may be taken by equalitie .9.16.25.36.49.64.81.
because they are found in both the armies, and in asmuch as anye
man taken beinge torned wyth hys bottome upward, &amp;that beareth
hys adversaries colloure, may serve his enemye on whose syde he
is taken, there maye yet be taken by equalitie .4. and .6.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<h2>Of taking by oblivion.</h2>

<p>By oblivion anye man maye be taken even the kinge him selfe, if
he be so compassed with .4. men, that hys lawfull draught be
hindered, as for example the round standing in the place of .1.
and .4. men of what kynd it skylleth not, occupying the places
of .2.3.4.5. after have set your last man in hys place may be
taken by, also if a triangle be enclosed, as in .a. with any
foure men standing in .b.c.d.e. he may be takenm even so may a
square be taken. Also Triangles and squares may be beseged, if al
the foure men or any of them, the rest standyng nearer, doe
standes in the thyrde or fourth space from them so that they have
no waye to remove, as a triangle or square standing in .A. may
be beseged by .4. men or anye of them (the reste standynge
nearer) in .F.G.H.I. Also a square standyng in .A. maye be
taken by oblivion, yf the fower</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>men or some of them (the rest standing nearer) doe stande in
.L.N.P.R. And this is sufficient for Oblivion, by which every man
may be taken in maner and forme as it hath bene taught.</p>

<h2>Of taking by Addition.</h2>

<p>When two numbers are so brought that they fynde one of theyr
enemies, which is as muche as bothe they beyng added together,
standing in such place as bothe they might remove into, they shall
take hym up, without removing into his place, so soone as the
latter of those two is set downe, but if the adversaries men be in
their daunger before they remove, one of them whether the player
lyst, shalbe removed into the place of that man which is taken
by Addition. As for example .12. the triangle is in .A. if you
can bring sixe the round, to stande in .B. and .6. the triangle
to stande in .G. because .6. and .6. being added make .12. and
bothe maye remove to .A. you maye take up the triangle</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>.12. by addition. Also .120. the square standing in .P. and
.49. the rounde standing in .B. or elles .49. the square
standing in .L. which being added together make .69. <i>[sic]</i>
which standeth in .A. shal take the sayde square .169. by Addition.</p>

<h2>Of taking by Subtraction.</h2>

<p>When two men do so stande, that the lesser beyng subtracted out
of the greater, the number remaining, is all one with the
adversaries man that standeth in both their draughtes, so soone
as the latter is set in his place, he may take awaye the
adversarie, not removing into his place, unlesse he finde him
so before he remove: as for as example, .2. the rounde standing in
.B. &amp; .9. the triangle standing in .6. <i>[sic -- I believe it means
.G.]</i> shall take theyr
adversarie .7. standynge in .A. for .2. out of .9. remayneth .7.
Another example.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>The rounde .2. standyng in .A. maye be taken by .30. the
Triangle standynge in .H. and the square .28. standynge in .P.
for take .28. out of .30. and their remaineth .2.</p>

<h2>Of takynge by multiplycation.</h2>

<p>When two numbers stande so, that being multiplied one by the
other, the producte is all one with their adversaryes man
standynge in both their draughts, they may take that man so
sone as the latter is placed. And if they lye so before thei
remove, being so left of the adversarie, one of them shal
succede in his place that is taken, as in example. The rounde
.3. standeth in .D. and .5. standeth in .C. these two shal take
the square .15. standynge in .A. because three tymes fyve is
.15. another example. The rounde .2. standing in .B. and the
triangle .6. standynge in .I. shall take their enemye the
triangle .12. standing in .A. by multiplycation for .2.
tymes .6. is .12.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<h2>Of takyng by division.</h2>

<p>By division a manne maye be taken, when twoo of hys enemyes
doe so stand, that one of them beyng devided by the other, the
product is the same that their enemye is, standynge in their
draught, immediatly after the latter is placed, the enemye may
be removed. If he were left in their daunger before removyng,
one of them may remove into his place, an example. The round
.4. standyng in .D. and the triangle .20. standing in .F. may
take the adversarie .5. standing in .A. by division, bycause
.4. in .20. is conteyned .5. tymes. Another example, the round
.5. standyng in .B. and the triangle .30. standynge in .F. maye
take their enemye .6. standynge in .A. for .5. in .30. is conteyned
.6. tymes.</p>

<h2>Of the takynge of the kynges.</h2>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>The game is never wonne, untyll the king be taken. The
kings (as hath bene sayde) may remove anye way, so they passe
not the fourth space. They can not be taken by equalitie. But
by oblivion the whole kyng maye be taken away. Also his whole
number at ones, that is .91. or .190. by Addition, by
Subtraction, by Multiplication, or by Division. Also he maye
be taken by partes, when any of hys syde numbers maye be
taken then [loseth?] he that draughte, as when anye of hys
square numbers is gone he can not remove the square draughtm
and so of the rest, tyl nothyng of him be left, then muste he
be taken away, and the triumph prepared.</p>

<h2>The lawe of prisoners.</h2>

<p>When any is taken captive, he must be tourned with his
conquerers collor upward &amp; placed in the hindermost space
of his victors campe, and from thens being removed must fight
against his conquerours enemies, and serve him also to make
his triumphe.</p>

<p>By this Table, any man though he have small or no skyll in
Arithmeticke, maye learne to playe at this game, and in playinge
learne some parte of Arithmeticke.</p>

<h2>Of takynge by proportion.</h2>

<p>If the Gamesters be disposed, they maye take men also by
proportion, Arithmeticall, Geometricall, or Musicall. But
because it is not necessarily required that they should so do,
I wyll fyrst prosecute the maner of triumph, in which also they maye
learne to take by proportion, as afterwarde shalbe seene. For
when they can joyne two or three of their men to one of their
adversaries men in such order as the triumph is set, so that
those three or foure numbers have anye of these three proportions
they maye take their adversaries man.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<h2>Of the triumphe.</h2>

<p>When the king is taken, the triumph must be prepared to be set
in the adversaries campe. The adversaries campe is called al the
space, that is betweene the first front of his men, as they were
first placed, unto the neither ende of the table, conteyning .40.
spaces or as some wil .48. When you entend to make a triumph you
must proclaime it, admonishing your adversarie, that he medle not
with anye man to take hym, whiche you have placed for youre
triumphe. Furthermore, you must bryng all your men that serve
for the triumph in their direct motions, and not in theyr flying
draughtes.</p>

<p>To triumphe therefore, is to place three or foure men within
the adversaries campe, in proportion Arithmeticall, Geometricall,
or Musicall, as wel of your owne men, as of your enemyes men that
be taken, standing in a right</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>lyne, direct or crosse, as in .D.A.B. or els .5.1.3. if it
consist of three numbers, but if it stande of foure numbers,
they maye be set lyke a square two agaynst two, as in 
.E.B.D.C. or .2.3.4.5. and after the same maner muste you
set them so that your adversaries man make the thyrde or
fourth, when you take by proportion.</p>

<h2>Of dyvers kyndes of triumphes.</h2>

<p>There be thre kyndes of triumphes a great triumphe, a
greater triumph, and the greatest and moste noble of all.</p>

<h2>Of the great triumph.</h2>

<p>The great triumph standeth in proportion, eyther
Arithmeticall, Geometrical, or Musical onely.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<h2>Of Arithmeticall proportion.</h2>

<p>Arithmeticall proportion, is when the mydle number differeth
as much from the first, as from the thyrde, that is to saye, when
the thyrde hath so many more, from the seconde as the seconde
hath from the firste, as .2.4.6. Here, two, is the distans, for
.4. excedeth .2. by two, &amp; .6. is more then foure by .2.</p>

<h2>A rule to fynde out Arithmeticall proportion between the
firste and the last.</h2>

<p>When you have the first and the last if you would finde out the
midle in proportion. Adde the first &amp; the last together, and devide
the whole into .2. for the halfe is the midle in proportion </p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>as I would
knowe what is the midle number in proportion betwene .5. and
.25. first I adde .5. to .20. <i>[sic]</i> that is .30. the half of
thirtie is .15. whiche is midle in proportion betwene .5. and .30.
<i>[sic]</i> so have I .5.15.35. <i>[sic]</i> in Arithmeticall
proportion.</p>

<h2>Of Geometricall proportion.</h2>

<p>Geometricall proportion, is when the seconde hath that
proportion to the first that the thyrde hath to the seconde,
as .2.4.8. as .4. excedeth .2. by .2. so .8. excedeth .4. by
.4.</p>

<h2>A rule to fynde the mydle number in Geometricall proportion.</h2>

<p>Multiplie the first by the thyrde, and of the product fynde out
the roote square, for that is the midle, if the numbers have
anye roote square in whole numbers. The roote square is a number
multiplied in it selfe, wherefore you muste seeke such a number,
as multiplied in it selfe, maketh the producte of the fyrst and
the thyrde number multiplied one by the other.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>As .20. multiplied by .45. is .900. the roote is .30. square,
whych multiplyed in is selfe is .900. But yf you lyste not to take

Geometricall proportion to be used in this game.</p>

<h2>Of Musicall proportion.</h2>

<p>Musicall proportion is when the differences of the first
and last from the middes, are the same, that is betwene the first
and the last, as .3.4.6.,
betwene .3. and .4. is .1. betwene .4. and .6. is .2. the whole
difference is .3. which is the difference betwene .6. and .3.
the first and the last.</p>

<h2>A rule to fynde the first, when you have the two last.</h2>

<p>Multiplie the seconde by the thyrd, devide the products by
the distans and the thyrde number, and the quotient is the
first, as havynge .6. and .12. I would fynde the first, .6.
tymes .12. is .72. the difference betwene .6. and .12. is
.6. whiche added to .12. is .18., devide .72. by .18. the
quotient is .4. so have you .4.6.12. in Musicall proportion.</p>

<p>And thus is the first kynd of playing at an end. And this
is sufficient to teach you to play, but if you would learne to
play conningly, you must use to playe often, so shall you learne
better then by anye preceptes or rules.</p>

<h2>Of the seconde kynde of playinge at the Philosophers game.</h2>

<p>There is in this kynde of playing to be considered, the table,
the men, the marking of them, the setting of them in araye, their
marching, their lawed of taking, and the maner of triumphynge.</p>

<h2>Of the Table.</h2>

<p>The Table is the same that was first described, namely a
double chessbord.</p>

<h2>Of the men.</h2>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>The men be as before in number .48.23. on a syde, and two
contrarye kynges of even and of odde. They must be of divers
colours, as hath bene sayde, the bottome of every one must
have his enemies colour, and his owne mark of number, differing
in this poinct from the former playing, that the enemies men
taken, may serve onely to celebrate a triumphe, but not to
fight on his syde that taketh them.</p>

<h2>Of the markyng of the men.</h2>

<p>They be marked with the same numbers, that have bene shewed
before and therefore so are to be founde out as is taught before.
But they be marked besyde their numbers, with cossicall signes,
which be signes used in the rule called <code>regula cossa</code>,
or <code>algebra</code>, betokening rootes, quadrats, cubes,
fouresquared quadrats, sursolides, &amp; quadrates of cubes. All
these .6. signes must be conteyned in thys game.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p><i>[Following is a chart giving the six signs. Since I can't
reproduce these in the text easily, I will use textual representations.
In the interests of my modern mind, I am using "r" to represent the
root, or by the power the root is being raised to.]</i></p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td rowspan="6">The signe</td><td>of the roote -- {r}</td></tr>
<tr><td>of the quadrate -- {2}</td></tr>
<tr><td>of the cube, or solide quadrat -- {3}</td></tr>
<tr><td>of the fouresquared quadrat -- {4}</td></tr>
<tr><td>of the sursolide -- {5}</td></tr>
<tr><td>of the squared cube -- {6}</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Every number maye be taken for a roote, as .2. this number
multiplyed in it self is a square as .4. The quadrat or square
multiplied by the roote geveth a cube or solide square, as
.4. multiplied by .2. geveth .8. that is a cube.</p>

<p>Multiplie the cube by the roote, so have you a squared quadrat, as
.8. by .2.  geveth .16. which is a qradrate of a a quadrate.</p>

<p>Multiplie the square or quadrat of quadrat by the roote, and
the product is the sursolide, as .2. tymes .16. is .32. whiche is
a sursolide. Multiplie the sursolide by the roote, and the product
is the quadrate of a cube, as .2. times .32. is .64. which is a
quadrat of a cube. So have you the roote, quadrat, cube, quadrat
of quadrat, sursolide, quadrat of cube .2.4.8.16.32.64.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>So .2. referred to .4. is a roote of a square, referred to .8.
it is a roote of a cube, .2. referred to .16. is the roote of a
fouresquared quadrate, .2. referred to .32. is the roote of a
sursolide, .2. referred to .64. is the roote of a quadrate of a
cube. These numbers muste have the proper cossicall signes.</p>

<p>Also one number having divers relations, may have divers
cossicall signes, as .9. referred to .81. being roote, hathe
the signe of a roote {r}, but beyng referred to .3. it hath the
signe of a quadrate, for it is a quadrate of .3. and is thus
signed {2}, and so of the rest that have like relation.</p>

<p><i>[When necessary, I will include multiple characters, so
the 9 above would be {r2}, since it is both a root and a
quadrat.]</i></p>

<h2>The marking of the men.</h2>

<p>The first order of roundes in bothe numbers, must have the
signe of the roote upon them al after this maner.</p>

<p><i>[First of several illustrations of the pieces. I will
use the same visuals that I have been using.]</i></p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>(8{r})</td><td>(6{r})</td><td>(4{r})</td><td>(2{r})</td></tr>
<tr><td>(9{r})</td><td>(7{r})</td><td>(5{r})</td><td>(3{r})</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>The second order of roundes founde out as before, be not all
marked with cossicall signes, but onely .4. and .9. with the roote,
and .81. with the quadrate. The rest have none because amonge their
adversaries men there is none that can be cossicall roote to them
in such maner as this game requireth.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>(64)</td><td>(36)</td><td>(16)</td><td>(4{r})</td></tr>
<tr><td>(81{2})</td><td>(49)</td><td>(25)</td><td>(9{r})</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The first order of triangles (havyng the same numbers that have
bene taught before) do all lack the cossicall signes, except onely
.6. which is signed with the roote.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>&lt;72&gt;</td><td>&lt;42&gt;</td><td>&lt;20&gt;</td><td>&lt;6{r}&gt;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;81&gt;</td><td>&lt;56&gt;</td><td>&lt;30&gt;</td><td>&lt;12&gt;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>The seconde order of triangles, have all excepts one (whiche is the
number of .100.) their cossicall signes, as .9. bothe of the roote and
of the quadrate, .25.36. and .49. have the signe of the quadrate .64.
of the quadrate and the cube, and also the quadrat of the cube .16. and
.81. of the quadrate, and the foure squared quadrate.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>&lt;81{24}&gt;</td><td>&lt;49{2}&gt;</td><td>&lt;25{2}&gt;</td><td>&lt;9{r2}&gt;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;100&gt;</td><td>&lt;64{236}&gt;</td><td>&lt;36{2}&gt;</td><td>&lt;16{24}&gt;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In the first order of squares, onely .15. is marked with the roote,
all the rest doe want theyr cossicall sygnes in thys game.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p><i>[A rather odd little illustration here, showing the two
kings in some detail, with each constituent pieces marked both
with its number and the square root of that number, and the
complete number of the king on the top. Also, a couple of odd
little images of a round and a square with a peculiar symbol
on top; this symbol may be peculiar to king components. Note
also that, in the table of squares below, the 91 and 190 have

<p>The seconde order of squares hath .3. numbers marked with
cossicall signes, that is .25. and .225. wyth the signe of the
quadrate .81. is marked with the sygne of the quadrate and the
fouresquared quadrate.</p>

<h2>The marching or moving.</h2>

<p>The men maye remove every way, into voyde places, forwarde,
backewarde, towarde both sydes, direct or cornerwyse. So that the
rounde men remove into the next space, the triangles into the
third place, and the squares into the fourth place, accompting
that place in which they stande for one.</p>

<p>Also every man savyng the two kynges to besiege his enemie,
or to flye from the siege himself, may remove the knights draught
in chesse, but neither take anye man (except it be by siege) nor
erect a triumphe by suche motions. The kynges move even as
squares, but that they have not the flyinge draughte.</p>

<p>It is compted lawefull amonge suche as wyll to agree, that the
Triangles and Squares, maye remove into voyde places, thoughe
the spaces betwene be occupyed of other men.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<h2>The maner of taking.</h2>

<p>The men may be taken seven ways by Oblivion, by Equalitie, by
Addition, by Subtraction, by Multiplication, by Division, and by
Cossicall Sygnes.</p>

<h2>Of takynge by Oblivion.</h2>

<p>All men maye be taken by Oblivion when by foure men they be
letted of theyr ordinarie draughte, as hath bene taught before.</p>

<h2>Of takynge by Equalitie.</h2>

<p>By Equalitie maye these men take or be taken, as hathe bene sayde
before, .9.16.25.36.49.64.81., as yf after you have played your .9.
stande in</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>your mans draught, you may take him by not removing into his
place, unlesse you espye him standing in your draught before you
playe, then muste you take him up and remove into his place.</p>

<h2>Of takynge by Addition.</h2>

<p>The takyng by Addition is all one with the first kynde of play,
in all respectes, saving that some require the men that shoulde
take by Addition to stande in the next spaces to him that is taken,
either directly, or cornerwyse, but the former waye is better.</p>

<h2>Of taking by Subtraction.</h2>

<p>That whiche was sayde in the first kinde of subtraction and that
whiche was last sayde of Addition may be bothe referred together.
For this subtraction</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>differeth not from the former, but for the opinion of them, that
would have the two takers stande onelye in the nexte spaces to him
that is taken.</p>

<h2>Of takyng by Multiplication.</h2>

<p>Takyng by multiplication doth differ. For in this kynde of playng,
it is thus. When your man standeth so, that beyng lesser than your
adversaries man, you may multiplie your man by the voyde spaces
betwene them, and the product is all one with the adversarye, you
maye take hym upm not removynge into his place, except you espye
hym so, before you remove your man.</p>

<h2>Of takynge by Division.</h2>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>Lykewise by Division, yf your man beyng greater then the adversarye,
stande so, that beyng devyded by the voyde spaces, the quotient is all
one with the adversarye, you maye take hym up, not removyng into hys
place, unlesse you see hym so standynge before you drawe.</p>

<h2>Of taking by Cossicall signes.</h2>

<p>By Cossicall sygnes anye man that hath these signes, 
{2}.{3}.{4}.{6}. meeting with his roote in his ordinary draught
that hath this signe {r} taketh him up, or elles is taken of
him, without removing into his place, except he maye take him
before he remove.</p>

<h2>Of the kynges, and their taking.</h2>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>The king of the even must be foursquare, havyng sixe steppes,
every one lesser then other, on one syde he muste have on him
these rootes .1.2.3.4.5.6. on the other syde the quadrates arising
of these rots, that is .1.4.9.16.25.36.</p>

<p>The king of the odde men, muste have but fyve steppes, that is
.4.5.6.7.8. lackyng the rootes that he can not ende in .1. The
quadrates of hys rootes by these .16.25.36.49.64. These muste be
so set on, that the least must be hyghest and the greatest
lowest.</p>

<p>The kinges be taken by Oblivion, or yf theyr Pyramidall number,
be taken by anye of the aforesayde meanes. Also yf by suche meanes
you can take all his quadrates one after another.</p>

<h2>The privilege of the king.</h2>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>If anye of the kynges quadrates be taken, he maye redeme it by
anye of his men having the same number, and muste remove into his
place, whiche redemed hym. But yf he have none of the same number,
he maye redeme hym for anye man of hys, that his adversarye wyll
chuse, and lykewyse remove into his place by whome he is redemed.</p>

<h2>Of the triumph.</h2>

<p>The triumph is after the Kynge be cleane taken away, to be
create in the adversaries campe, as well of your owne men as
of your adversaries men that be taken, or of both in proportion
as hath bene shewed before, and proclaimed that those men
ons placed, may not be taken, as it was declared sufficiently,
and no difference betwene the triumphes, savyng that some wyll
not alowe a triumphe but of foure numbers, and two proportions
at the lest. All three for the greater victorie, makynge but
two kyndes of triumphes.</p>

<h2>Here foloweth the thyrd kynde of playing at the Philosophers
game.</h2>

<p>There must also in this thyrd kynde be considered the table, the
men, their markyng, the order of theyr battell, the motions, their
taking, and last of all theyr triumphing.</p>

<p>The table is the same that hath bene twyse already discribed.
Yet some wyll not have it so longe, but at the lest is must
conteyne .10. squares in length and alwayes .8. in breadth. The
longest is best.</p>

<h2>Of the men.</h2>

<p>The men be .48. as it hath bene told of two contrary collor, the
head and bottom all of one collor, because men ons taken be no more
occupyed in thys kynde of playing.</p>

<h2>The inscription and fashion.</h2>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>The fasion is as hath bene last declared both of the men, and of
the kynges, the inscription of numbers the same, but without
cossical signes.</p>

<h2>Of the order of the battell.</h2>

<p>The order of battell is after the firste maner, but not so
farre from the bordes end, namely the .4. squares standynge in
the plattes nearest to the bordes end the rest accordingly
joined to them, as in the first kynde of playing.</p>

<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<h2>Of their motions.</h2>

<p>The men move frowarde and backward, to the right hand, and to
the left hande, but not cornerwise, except the gamesters so agree,
the rounds into the next space, the triangles into the thyrde, and
the squares into the fourth, the kyngs move as squares. And these
be their ordinary draughts in marching.</p>

<h2>Of their taking.</h2>

<p>They are taken by encountering, bu eruption, by laying wayght,
and by Oblivion.</p>

<h2>Of takyng by encountering.</h2>

<p>To take by encountering is to take by Equalitie, as hath bene
twyse before declared.</p>

<h2>Of taking by eruption.</h2>

<p>To take by eruption is when a lesse number beyng multiplied
by the spaces that are betwene him &amp; hys adversary, the product
is asmuch as his adversary, he may take his enemie awaye whether
he stand directly from him or cornerwise.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>For men that may be taken by eruption looke in the table
of takyng by multiplication in the second kynd of playing.</p>

<h2>Of takyng by deceypt or lying weyght.</h2>

<p>To take by deceypt or lying weight, is to take by addition,
not as before when the adversary standeth within the draught
of two men which being added make the juste number of the adversary,
but when the .2. numbers that are to be added, stande in the next
spaces to the adversarie. For to take by deceipt, looke in the table
that was set forth for takyng by addition in the first kynde of
playinge.</p>

<h2>Of taking by Oblivion.</h2>

<p>By Oblivion all men may be taken, when foure men besiege the
adversarye, standynge in the foure nexte</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>spaces about him directly, or cornerwise, the man so besieged
can not escape, because he can not remove cornerwyse, therefore
maye be taken up, so soone as the last of the foure is set in his
place.</p>

<p>In all three kyndes of playing no Oblivion can be of any man with
some of his fellowes, but all foure muste be hys adversaries.</p>

<p>In this thyrde kynde, these men can be none otherwyse taken but
by Oblivion. Namely amonge the even .2.4.4.135. among the odde
.3.5.7.190.</p>

<p>In all maner of taking this is to be noted, that we muste not
place the man which taketh in place of him that is taken, but when
he maye be taken before we drawe, then shall we remove our man into
his place.</p>

<h2>The privilege of the king.</h2>

<p>The king standeth for so many men as he hath steppes, that is
the even for .6. the odde for .5. if anye of these</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>(except the lowest and greatest) be taken the king may redeme hym,
by any man of his that is of the same number. If he have none of the
same number, he maye redeme him be any of his men that hys
adversary wyll chuse. But if his lowest square be taken, no ransom
will delyver him. Also if the whole kyng at ons that is the whole
number of Pyramis be taken, he can not be redemed.</p>

<h2>Of the triumphe.</h2>

<p>To take awaye the tediousnes of long play from them that be yonge
beginners, wryters of this game have invented divers kyndes of
shorte victories, wherefore they devide victory into proper and
common. Of the proper victory need nothing here be spoken, for all
things thereto belonging are sufficientlu set forth in the first
kind of playing.</p>

<h2>Of the common victory.</h2>

<p>The common victorie (they say) is after fyve maners, for men
contende either for bodies, goods, quarrelles, honour, or els
for both quarels &amp; honor.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<h2>Victory of bodies.</h2>

<p>Victory of bodies is only to take a certain number of men, as
if the gamesters agree, that he which first taketh .4. or .5.
or .6. or .10. men &amp;c, shall wyn the game.</p>

<h2>Victorye of goods.</h2>

<p>Victorie of goods, is to take a certain number without respect
of the men. As if it be covenanted, that he which first taketh
men amounting to the number of .100. or .200. shall have the
victorie.</p>

<h2>Victory of quarell.</h2>

<p>Victorie of quarell is when neither the men, nor the number,
but the characters of the number be considered. As if it be
determined that he which first taketh .100. in .8. characters
not regarding in how many men they standes, shall winne. As
.2.4.5.8.24.64. so you have .100. in .8. characters it skilleth
not, although there be more then .100. as in this example there
is more then .100. by .4.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<h2>Victorie of honour.</h2>

<p>Victorie of honour, is whe a determined number is made in a
determined number of men, as if it be determined that he whiche
first cometh to .100. in .8. men, shall winne the game. As in
these .2.4.6.8.4.16.45.15. And though there were somewhat more
then .100. so it be in .8. men, it skilleth not.</p>

<h2>Of victorie of honour and quarell.</h2>

<p>The victorie of honour and quarell, is when one obteyneth
the decreed number, in the decreed number of men and the decreed
number of characters: as let .100. be the decreed number .8. the
determined number of men, and .9. the determined number of
characters. He that obteyneth .2.4.6.8.4.6.9.64. obteineth the
victorie of honour and quarell. It shalbe no hinderance though .8.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>men and .9. characters conteyne somwhat more then .100. so that
there be not .100. upon one man, as in the victorie before.</p>

<h2>Victorie of standers.</h2>

<p>They have invented another victorie, that is of standerdes,
by counterfeyting two armies, one of the Christians, another
of the Turkes. The whyte men, that is the even hoste,
conteyneth .1312. footemen (not compting the rootes of squares
expressed in the kynges) let the first and last be captaines
and let them devide the whole armye into .10. standerds so
every standerd shall have .130. men, besyde the two captaines
and the ten standard bearers. The black men, that is the odde
armie (except the kings rootes) be .1752. The two captaynes
and ten standerd bearers taken out, there remayneth .1740. souldyers,
to every standerd .174. He that wynneth more standers have the
victorye. If the even hoste</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------->
<p><i>[Page]</i></p>

<p>wyne .348. men he hath obtayned two standerds if he wynne .522.
he hath gotten thre standerds and forth of the rest.</p>

<p>If the odde armye wynne .260. they wyn two standerds .390.
three standerds and so of the rest.</p>
