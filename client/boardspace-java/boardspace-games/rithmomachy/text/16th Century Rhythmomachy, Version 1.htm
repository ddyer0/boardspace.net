Game Report: 16th Century Rhythmomachy (Version 1)</h1>

<h2>
Class: Board</h2>

<h2>
Type: Strategy</h2>

<h2>
Number of Players: 2</h2>

<h2>
Reconstructed mainly from primary source</h2>
<b>Date redacted:</b> March 23, 1998

<p><b>Redactor:</b> Justin

</p><p><b>Sources:</b> Fulke's <a href="http://jducoeur.org/game-hist/fulke.html">The Philosopher's Game</a>.&nbsp;
This is the first of the three variants he describes.
</p><h3>
Reconstruction</h3>
For basic information about Rhythmomachy, please see the description of
<a href="http://jducoeur.org/game-hist/game-recon-rhythbasics.html">Rhythmomachy Basics</a>.&nbsp;
That sets out the basic information about the board, the men, and some
of the mathematical basis of the game.&nbsp; I assume that the reader has
read that first.

<p>This particular version of Rhythmomachy is my personal favorite.&nbsp;
It is in many respects the strangest variant: the rules are considerably
different from the "main" versions of Rhythmomachy that were common for
much of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.&nbsp; It really cannot be justified
outside the 16th century, although it is possible that it was known earlier.&nbsp;
However, it is significantly more consistent, and arguably easier to learn
and play, than the main version.

</p><p>The reconstruction here is rather long; however, there is a concise
summary at the end.&nbsp; The game actually summarizes very briefly --
much of the length here is in describing all of the little caveats, and
a few of the odder concepts.&nbsp; (Along with lots of examples.)
</p><h4>
Board Setup</h4>
The board arrangement is shown in the attached <a href="http://jducoeur.org/game-hist/rythboard.doc">Microsoft
Word 97 document</a>.&nbsp; (Sorry to those who don't have a current version
of Word, but I haven't had time to produce a GIF yet.)&nbsp; A rougher
version, in table form, can be found in <a href="http://jducoeur.org/game-hist/fulke.html">Fulke</a>.
Or, you can look at <a href="http://jducoeur.org/game-hist/rythboard3.gif">this GIF</a> -- the difference
is that, in this version, all the men should be advanced by two rows (that
is, on your rows 3-6, instead of 1-4).
<h4>
Movement of the Men</h4>
The rounds, triangles, and squares move differently.&nbsp; I use the following
diagram to show how they all move (the diagram is adapted from Fulke).

<p>In all of the following descriptions, the man begins on A; I describe
where he can move to.&nbsp; You can not jump over another man during a
movement, either one of your own, or an opponent's.

</p><p>For the triangles and squares, there are two distinct forms of movement,
normal and "flying".&nbsp; I confess, it isn't absolutely clear to me what
flying refers to.&nbsp; It may mean when you are about to be attacked,
and are running away; or, it may mean any time except when you are attacking.&nbsp;
I currently believe the latter interpretation is more likely.&nbsp; Thus,
you may use the flying movement unless the move would result in taking
an opposing man.

</p><p><i>The Rounds:</i>&nbsp; The round pieces move one step diagonally.&nbsp;
Thus, a round on A can move to B, C, D, or E.

</p><p><i>The Triangles:</i><b>&nbsp;</b> The triangles move orthogonally (that
is, horizontally or vertically), two spaces.&nbsp; Thus, a triangle on
A can move to F, G, H, or I.&nbsp; When flying, a triangle may make the
knight's move from Chess -- that is, two spaces either horizontally or
vertically, and then one more to the side.&nbsp; Thus, a triangle flying
from A could move into any of spaces 1 - 8.&nbsp; Note that you still cannot
jump over a man when flying, so you could not move from A to 1 if there
was a man standing in F.&nbsp; (Fulke is not completely clear on this point;
I infer it from the way Capture by Oblivion works.)

</p><p><i>The Squares:</i>&nbsp; The squares move orthogonally, three spaces.&nbsp;
Thus, a square on A can move to L, M, N, or O.&nbsp; When flying, a square
can make a sort of elongated knight's move -- that is, three spaces horizontally
or vertically, then one to the side.&nbsp; Thus, a square flying from A
can more to any of 11 - 18.&nbsp; (The same caveats apply as with the triangles,
with respect to jumping over other men.)

</p><p><i>The Kings:&nbsp;</i> The Kings can move in any of the ways that their
constituent pieces can.&nbsp; Since a King starts with Rounds, Triangles,
and Squares, it can move with all of the movements of all of those pieces.&nbsp;
However, a King can lose some of those constituents during play; that is,
the enemy can capture pieces out of the King's pyramid.&nbsp; If the King
loses all of the pieces of a given shape, it loses the ability to move
like that shape.&nbsp; So if both triangles in a King are captured, it
can no longer move like a triangle.

</p><p>Fulke talks, somewhat cryptically, about the Kings being able to move
in all the ways that a Chess Queen can move, within a three-space span.&nbsp;
This would seem to obviate the fact that movements go away as the King
loses components, though, and seems generally a little inconsistent with
how the rest of things run.&nbsp; So I tend to ignore this, since I don't
entirely understand it.
</p><h4>
Capture</h4>
Rythmomachy, in all its variants, provides numerous ways to capture an
opponent.&nbsp; The main thing that makes this version different is that
those captures are somewhat more consistent than usual.

<p>The most important, and sometimes confusing, aspect of capture in Rhythmomachy
is that you don't actually have to jump onto an enemy man to capture him.&nbsp;
In Chess, you capture the opposing piece by moving one of your pieces into
his square.&nbsp; In Rhythmomachy, you only have to set up the position
-- as soon as you <i>could</i> capture him, you do so.&nbsp; Alternatively,
you <i>can</i> capture by jumping onto the enemy man, but you don't have
to; you can essentially capture a move earlier.&nbsp; The result is that
you must pay much more attention in Rhythmomachy than in Chess: by the
time a man is in check, he is already captured.&nbsp; This will be made
a little clearer by looking at the simplest example: Capture by Equality.

</p><p><i>Capture by Equality:</i>&nbsp; The simplest capture (although the
rarest) is Capture by Equality.&nbsp; This just means that a man can capture
another man with the same number: a 9 can capture the other 9, an 81 the
other 81, a 4 the other 4, and like that.

</p><p>As alluded to above, you <i>can</i> capture this way by simply leaping
onto the other man, if that is a legal move for your piece.&nbsp; If it
is your turn, and you have the round 81 on A, and the enemy square 81 is
on B, your round can jump onto his square and capture it, because B is
a legal move for a round on A.&nbsp; However, you will usually capture
just by setting it up.&nbsp; Say instead that it is your turn, your round
81 is on C, and the enemy square 81 is on B.&nbsp; You move your round
to A.&nbsp; Since the enemy is now within reach of yours, it is <i>immediately</i>
captured, without you moving your piece into the enemy space.&nbsp; (However,
note that the enemy man must be in a space that is a legal move for yours.)

</p><p>Capture is therefore much richer in Rhythmomachy than Chess.&nbsp; Indeed,
although the Fulke doesn't say it, you should be able to make multiple
captures with a single move -- if you move your man so that it attacks
multiple enemies, they should all go away.&nbsp; (This is incredibly difficult
to set up, but quite stylish.)

</p><p><i>Capture by Addition</i>:&nbsp; The other captures are mostly pretty
much alike; I will start by illustrating the simplest case, addition.&nbsp;
If you place two of your men, such that <i>both</i> of them could legally
jump onto an enemy man, and they add up to its value, the enemy is immediately
taken.

</p><p>So, for example, say that the round black 16 is on A, and you have a
round white 9 on B and a round white 7 on F.&nbsp; You move the 7 to C.&nbsp;
Since the 9 and the 7 could both legally move to A, and they add up to
16, the 16 on A is immediately captured.

</p><p>Alternately, say that you have your round 9 and 7 on B and C.&nbsp;
On your opponent's turn, he foolishly moves the 16 to A.&nbsp; You may
now capture the 16, but you have to actually jump onto it -- either the
9 or the 7 (it doesn't matter which), must jump onto the 16, and thereby
take it.

</p><p>So like with Capture by Equality, there are two ways to do Capture by
Addition: moving your pieces so that they <i>could</i> jump onto the enemy,
or actually jumping onto it on your turn.

</p><p><i>Capture by Subtraction, Multiplication, Division:&nbsp;</i> These
work essentially the same as Capture by Addition.&nbsp; In each case, you
arrange two of your pieces, whose numbers relate to the enemy piece, so
that both of them could legally move onto it.&nbsp; Examples:

</p><p>If the black 4 is sitting on A, and the white 9 is on B, and you move
the white 5 onto C (all of them being round), you capture the 4 by Subtraction.

</p><p>If the black square 15 is on A, and the white round 3 is on B, and you
move the white round 5 onto C, you capture the 15 by Multiplication.

</p><p>If the black triangle 25 is on A, and the white round 9 is on B, and
you move the white square 225 onto C, you capture the 25 by Division.

</p><p><i>(Optional) Capture by Arithmetic, Geometric, or Harmonic Proportion:&nbsp;</i>
Fulke mentions that you can also capture by one of the proportions (which
are described in the Basic Rhythmomachy paper).&nbsp; He does not give
much detail, but it seems pretty obvious based on the other captures: you
capture by proportion if your two men and the enemy man together form one
of the proportions, and you move your men so that they could move onto
the enemy.&nbsp; I consider this Capture an advanced variant, and don't
recommend it for beginners.&nbsp; Fulke makes it clear that this is optional,
and should be agreed on in advance.

</p><p><i>Capture by Oblivion:&nbsp;</i> The exception to the above patterns
is the simple Capture by Oblivion.&nbsp; This basically means surrounding
the enemy piece so that it can not move.&nbsp; Thus, to capture a round
piece that is on A by Oblivion, you must place men on B, C, D, and E.&nbsp;
To capture a triangle in A by Oblivion, you must place men in F or S, G
or V, H or Y, and I or T.&nbsp; (That is, you need to block the triangle
from making any legal moves.)&nbsp; To capture a square in A, you must
place men at, or closer than, L, M, N, or O.&nbsp; Since the flying moves
are the normal moves, plus one step to the side, blocking the normal moves
suffices to block the flying ones as well.&nbsp; In Capture by Oblivion,
you must actually surround the enemy man -- it is not sufficient to be
able to surround him.

</p><p>Fulke is not clear about some of the finer details here.&nbsp; It isn't
clear whether your own men count towards a Capture by Oblivion; I doubt
it, but it is possible.&nbsp; (I doubt it because many men begin the game
so blocked.)&nbsp; It also isn't clear whether the edges of the board count;
again, I doubt it.&nbsp; I recommend playing that a Capture by Oblivion
requires actually blocking all four sides with enemy men, but this is open
to interpretation.

</p><p><i>Turning the Enemy:&nbsp;</i> In all cases, capturing an enemy man
does more than take him off the board -- he actually begins to work for
you.&nbsp; When you capture an enemy man, flip him over, so that your color
is showing.&nbsp; (This is why Rhythmomachy pieces should be double-sided.)&nbsp;
Place him on your end of the board, in any of the squares in your first
rank.&nbsp; From then on, the piece belongs to you, and can act like one
of your men (unless, of course, your opponent recaptures it).

</p><p>This is actually quite important: due to the way the higher victories
are constructed, you can only win some of them with the aid of some of
your opponent's pieces.&nbsp; It also tends to shorten the game somewhat;
since captured pieces are not only lost by one player, but gained by the
other, the game slowly unbalances once someone gets the upper hand.
</p><h4>
The Major Victories</h4>
Officially speaking, there are only three victories allowed in this version
of the game; they are all fairly similar, and they are all a bit difficult.&nbsp;
In all cases, you must first capture your opponent's King, and then make
an arrangement of your men in your opponent's camp.&nbsp; (His camp being
defined as the region of the board where his men started: his back six
rows.)

<p>They go like this:

</p><p><i>The Great Triumph:&nbsp;</i> Begin by announcing that you are going
to make a triumph, and which men you are going to use to do it; these three
men must make up an arithmetic, geometric, or harmonic proportion.&nbsp;
From then on, your opponent can not capture those men; however, those men
can no longer use their flying movements.&nbsp; Move those men into enemy
territory, so that they form a connected line, horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal.&nbsp; As soon as they are in place, you win.

</p><p><i>The Greater Triumph:&nbsp;</i> This is the same as the Great Triumph,
except that you must use four men, which make any two of the proportions
together.&nbsp; They do not have to form a straight line; they may instead
make a square. (So you could have men in B, C, D, and E.)

</p><p><i>The Greatest Triumph:&nbsp;</i> This is the same as the Greater Triumph,
except that you must make all three of the proportions using the four men.

</p><p>Fulke has detailed tables giving all of the possible combinations of
men that can be used in the Major Victories; I commend them, especially
if you want to try either the Greater or Greatest Triumphs.

</p><p><b>The Common Victories</b>

</p><p>Fulke also lists a number of much simpler victories; he lists them with
a different version of the game, but I commend them to beginning and intermediate
players, as a way to finish the game more rapidly and without needing to
get into the Proportions.&nbsp; You should discuss this with your opponent
before beginning the game, and agree on which Victory you are going to
play for.&nbsp; They all involve the number and kind of men that you capture;
they do not require capture of the King, or the creation of proportions
in enemy territory.&nbsp; They are listed below, roughly in order of difficulty.

</p><p><i>Victory of Bodies:</i>&nbsp; To achieve victory of bodies, you just
need to be the first player to capture an agreed-upon number of men.&nbsp;
I recommend 6 men as a reasonable goal for a game of modest length, but
you can set it as high or low as you prefer.&nbsp; Note that the strategies
get odd here -- you wind up shooting to capture as many easy pieces as
possible.

</p><p><i>Victory of Goods:&nbsp; </i>To achieve victory of goods, you need
to capture a certain number of points first, not a specific number of men;
that is, you add up the numbers on all of the men you have captured.&nbsp;
A good number seems somewhere between 100 and 200.&nbsp; However, note
that this also skews the strategies, because capturing a single really
big piece can win the game.

</p><p><i>Victory of Quarrel:&nbsp;</i> This one is a bit curious -- you agree
to capture a certain number of points and a number of <i>characters</i>.&nbsp;
That is, if you agree to capture 100 in 8 characters, you must have at
least 100 points, and at least 8 characters showing on those men.&nbsp;
So, for instance, if you capture the 2, 4, 6, 8, 25, and 64, it would satisfy
this victory: you have 109 points, and there are 8 characters showing on
the men.

</p><p><i>Victory of Honor:&nbsp;</i> This is the combination of Victory of
Bodies and Victory of Goods -- you must make a specified number of points,
and a specified number of men.&nbsp; Thus, you might have to capture at
least 100 points, and at least 8 men.&nbsp; This helps to adjust the unbalancing
effects that Victory of Bodies and Victory Goods have on game strategies
by themselves.&nbsp; I particularly recommend this as a good victory for
intermediate players, who aren't quite ready for the Major Victories, but
want something that will take a little more thought.

</p><p><i>Victory of Honor and Quarrel:&nbsp;</i> This combines all of the
above: you must capture at least a specified number of men, a number of
points, and a number of characters.&nbsp; So for instance, you might have
to capture 100 points, 8 men, and 10 characters.
</p><h4>
Evaluation</h4>
Rhythmomachy is not only one of the most important games of period, it
is one of the coolest.&nbsp; It is remarkable in that it is very nearly
the only period game for which nothing even remotely similar exists today.&nbsp;
It requires skill, thought, and strategy.&nbsp; It isn't really as complex
as the above description may sound, though -- it is roughly as complex
as Chess, requiring some learning, but not a huge amount.

<p>This version is my personal favorite, even though it is the least common
from period: it is relatively balanced, and very consistent.

</p><p>It does require some learning, and I won't kid you: it takes years to
get good at it.&nbsp; On the other hand, you can comfort yourself with
the fact that no one around you is good at it either, so you don't have
to deal with people coming in and just crushing you through experience.
</p><h4>
Summary</h4>
This is not intended to be comprehensive; rather, it serves as a quick
reminder of what is going on.&nbsp; See the above descriptions for details.
<ul>
<li>
Rounds move one space diagonally; triangles move two spaces orthogonally;
squares move three spaces orthogonally.&nbsp; Triangles can fly with the
chess-knight's move; squares can do the same with an elongated move.&nbsp;
You can only fly if you are not attacking.&nbsp; Kings can move with any
of the moves of their constituent pieces.</li>

<li>
All captures except Oblivion can be made by putting your pieces into a
legal position to jump onto the enemy piece, but you can also capture by
actually jumping onto it.</li>

<li>
Capture by Equality is capturing an enemy man with a piece of the same
value.</li>

<li>
Capture by Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division are made
by putting two of your men into position against an enemy man that is the
result of that mathematical operation.</li>

<li>
Capture by Arithmetic, Geometric, and Harmonic proportion are made by putting
two of your men into position against an enemy man, such that the three
form one of the proportions.&nbsp; It is optional; you should agree with
your opponent in advance if you plan to play with these.</li>

<li>
Capture by Oblivion is made by surrounding an enemy man on all four sides,
so that he can not make any of his legal moves.</li>

<li>
In all cases, when you capture an enemy man, you flip him over to your
color, then re-enter him at your end of the board.</li>

<li>
The Major Victories are achieved by arranging three or four of your men,
which form Arithmetic, Geometric, and/or Harmonic proportions, in enemy
territory, after capturing the enemy King.</li>

<li>
The Common Victories are achieved by capturing a specified number of enemy
men, points, and/or characters on pieces.</li>
</ul>
