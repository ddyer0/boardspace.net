<h1>Rithmomachia, the Philosophers' Game<br>
A Mediaeval Battle of Numbers</h1>

<h3>Peter Mebben</h3>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>'A knowledge of the battle of numbers is a source of enjoyment and of
profit.' John of Salisbury stated this praise in his Policraticus
(I,5) in 1180, when reporting about the use and abuse of games. When
the mediaeval scholar talked about this competition of numbers, he
meant Rithmomachia, which he got to know as a useful and pleasant
teaching aid for arithmetical lessons. This game had spread from
monastery schools in southern Germany to England. (Evans 1976)</p>

<p>What kind of game is it that John of Salisbury highly praises? What
made him and other people talk about Rithmomachia so long ago, after
it had been almost forgotten after a prime of about 700 years?</p>

<p>Roger Bacon also recommended Rithmomachia to his students in his
'communio mathematica' (I, 3,4) in the 13th century. He listed seven
points on how his students should learn their arithmetics according to
Boethius, and at the end he advised that they use the game
Rithmomachia as a teaching aid. As Thomas More was convinced of the
good character of the game, he let the fictious inhabitants of
'Utopia' (1516. II,5) play it for recreation in the evening hours. As
well Robert Burton regarded the use of Rithmomachia as an efficient
cure for melancholy, because it is a good exercise for the human
spirit. (The Anatomy of Melancholy. 1651. II,4)</p>

<p>The name of the game is of Greek origin. The first part 'Rithmo-' is
derived from a combination of arithmos and rhythmos. Arithmos means
number and rhythmos had, besides rhythm, also the meaning number and
proportion of numbers in the Middle Ages, because not only is the game
about the numbers on the pieces, but also about the relation between
numbers. The second part of the name '-machia' comes from machos,
which means battle. Therefore Rithmomachia can be described as a
'battle of numbers'. In England the game was also known as the
'Philosophers' Game'.</p>

<p>Rithmomachia is a strategy game for two players. A black and a white
party of numbers face each other, similar to chess. There was a time
when Rithmomachia was in competition with chess and was even more
respected than chess, for example in some mediaeval treatises
Rithmomachia was favoured. (Folkerts 1989) The reason was, that
Rithmomachia was the only game in the curriculum of the mediaeval
schools and universities - an honour which chess had never received,
because it was played as a tactical war game in the nobility for pure
entertainment, but it did not suit the canon of the seven liberal
arts. In Rithmomachia the aim is not to fight against each other with
armies of numbers, rather to take part in a contest, where the players
must bring some of their pieces into a harmonious order.</p>

<p>Contrasts between black and white, even and odd, equality and
inequality develop and are in the end resolved into
harmony. Especially the latter two pairs appear in the philosophy of
numbers of Boethius, which dictates a selection of numbers on the
pieces. (Borst 1990). The Boethius number theory is based on the
Pythagorean philosophy of numbers, which deals with classification,
sequences, and figured presentation of numbers (figurative numbers),
and the harmonical proportion between the numbers. All of these
features of Boethius' number theory recur in the game of
Rithmomachia. Pythagoras' number symbolism, as a part of Boethius'
philosophy of numbers, was of particular interest during the period of
origin of Rithmomachia. The complete world order was searched for
within and represented by this number symbolism. (Coughtrie
1984). Rithmomachia was an entertaining way to memorize the number
theory of Boethius. Basically, it was a pleasure to play Rithmomachia,
the only game accepted by the Christian scientific community of the
Middle Ages, because, unlike chess and dicing games, it was of great
use.</p>


<h2>2. The History of Rithmomachia</h2>

<p>In many old records Boethius or Pythagoras were presumed as the
inventors of Rithmomachia, however, they only created the mathematical
basis of this game. It is certain, that the oldest written evidence of
Rithmomachia was found in W?rzburg around 1030. At a competition
between the cathedral schools of Worms and W?rzburg, both well-known
for their leading position at arithmetics, a disputational text was
written with arithmetical sequences of numbers based on 'De
institutione arithmetica' of Boethius. On the basis of these writings
a monk by the name Asilo created a game - Rithmomachia - which
illustrated the number theory of Boethius for the students of
monastery schools.</p>

<p>The first outline was adapted by other scholars. Hermannus Contractus,
respected monk in Reichenau, checked the rules of the game written by
Asilo, enlarged them and added music theoretical remarks. At a school
in Li?ge, they worked out a way of realising the game practically not
only to enhance the game itself, but also to improve the training of
the students in arithmetics. (Borst 1987).</p>

<p>In the 11th and 12th century Rithmomachia spread through monastery
schools in southern Germany and France. There the rules were
collected, ordered and summarised. The rules became more extensive,
and sufficient enough to be played without a teacher. Rithmomachia was
an excellent teaching aid. Gradually it was also played by
intellectuals just for pleasure. In the 13th century Rithmomachia
spread through France and swept over into England. The mathematician
Bradwardine and some of his colleagues wrote a text about
Rithmomachia, and even in the pseudo-ovidian poem 'De vetula',
Rithmomachia was highly praised.</p>

<p>Rithmomachia reached the greatest expansion at the time of book
printing. The books written about Rithmomachia had various
intentions. Faber (1496) and Boissi?re (1554/56), both professors of
mathematics, wrote their treatises for their students at the
university of Paris. Faber and a later Italian adapter, whose text is
called 'Florentine dialogue' (1539) adopted even the form of the Greek
didactic dialogue and the Pythagorean tradition again according to
their times. Shirwood (1474) and Fulke/Lever (1563) wrote their book
about Rithmomachia for their sovereigns or patrons. The hand-written
manuscript by Abraham Ries (1562) was written with the same
intention. Abraham Ries was the second son and heir of the
mathematical talents of the most well-known German Rechenmeister
(arithmetic teacher) Adam Ries. Selenus (1616), whose real name is
duke August II of Brunswick-L?neburg, published his Rithmomachia as an
appendix to his book about chess. All these texts were characterised
by the fact that Rithmomachia was merely played by intellectuals for
pure pleasure and mental recreation. (Illmer 1987) Rithmomachia was
known at this time mainly in England, France, Italy and eastern
Germany.</p>

<p>At the end of the 17th century Rithmomachia lost its great
popularity. The mathematician and philosopher Leibniz knew only the
name, not the rules of the game. The main subject of mathematics
changed during that time. The introduction of the zero, the
integration and differentiation of integrals, the calculation with
fractions and smallest units did not fit into the number theory of
Boethius. Mathematics moved towards the calculation of chance with
probability calculus.(Folkerts 1989)</p>

<p>Chess became the great game of that time, and protected the traditions
of Rithmomachia mainly in Germany despite its unpopularity of the
time. Because Selenus, as a great enthusiast of chess printed his
version of Rithmomachia in the appendix of his book of chess, later
writers of chess books included Rithmomachia as 'arithmetical chess'
in German speaking area. (Allgaier 1796, Waidder 1837, also Koch 1803)
In a similar way Zimmermann (1821) adapted Rithmomachia to checkers
(in German, Dame) as 'Zahl-Damenspiel' (numerical checkers). Until now
Rithmomachia is described particularly in game books. (Archiv 1819,
Jahn 1917, Strutt 1801) Two German teachers were also inspired by
Selenus to announce Rithmomachia again. Adler, a passionate
mathematician and chess player, discovered the didactical profit of
Rithmomachia and published a text with the rules in his school
programme in 1852, but he received no greater attention. (Jahn
1917). 65 years later Jahn, parish priest and rector of the Z?llchower
Anstalten near Stettin, took up the game in effort to contribute to a
greater popularity, but he suffered the same meager results. (1917,
1929?)</p>

<p>For more than 100 years the academic research of the origin of
Rithmomachia and the mediaeval history of it developed independently
to the traditions of the game. In 1986 this academic research obtained
with 'Das mittelalterliche Zahlenkampfspiel' by Borst a basic work, in
which the oldest source texts are edited.</p>

<p>The mediaeval traditions of Rithmomachia are certain. Illmer (1987)
however suspects, that Rithmomachia is older. There are conspicuous
parallels between the raising and the moves of the pieces and the
raising and the mobility of Roman armies. Already in approximately
1070 in Li?ge this Roman model provided the players with an easier way
of playing. (Borst 1986) There are, however, no testimonies of texts,
but generally the sources of texts about ancient board games are very
short, like, for example, in different works by Plato. An exact
description or even a rule of the game is difficult to
reconstruct. Also no archaeological evidence has been hitherto
found. There have been no pieces found neither ancient nor mediaeval.</p>


<h2>3. The Rules of Rithmomachia</h2>

<p>There is no one set of rules for Rithmomachia. During the 1000-year
history of the game the rules have changed often. The extent increased
from few hand-written pages to more than 100 printed pages, in which
detailed the mathematical and harmonic backgrounds are described. But
the rules have the following things in common: the number of pieces
with the numbers printed on them, the two pyramids and a rectangular
board. In addition the goal of the game is common: Two players try to
build through fixed moves an arrangement of three or four pieces on
the opponent's side of the board. The numbers of the pieces must be in
a specific proportion to each other and with the arrangement of one of
these groups the player gains victory. In the process the opponent's
pieces can be captured according to certain rules. Depending on
whether one seeks a perfect game or an easier version of it, the size
of the board and other details of the rules may vary.</p>

<p>The rules presented here correspond mostly to the way Rithmomachia was
played during the 17th century, before it retreated in a shadowy
existence. (1) These rules are suitable for playing today.</p>


<h3>A. Preparations</h3>

<p>Rithmomachia is played on a board of 16 by 8 squares. The white and
black pieces have numbers written on them according to the number
theory of Boethius.</p>

<pre>***fig. 1: The numbers on the pieces according to the number theory of Boethius***
***see at the end***
</pre>

<p>The second and proceeding rows of numbers are derived from the
first. The white pieces are called the even and the black are called
the odd, but there are odd numbers in the even party and vice versa.</p>

<p>On the round pieces the multiples (multiplices) are placed. The base
row is built from multiples of 1. In the second row the base numbers
are multiplied with themselves. The numbers on the triangles are the
superparticulares. They contain the preceding number and one fraction
of it ([n + 1] / n). The numbers on the squares are built with the
preceding number and a multiple fraction of it ([n + 2] / [n +
1]). They are the superpartientes. There are many mathematical
relations between the numbers. Boethius gave several procedures for
derivation of the numbers. One of these mathematical relations is that
the first row of triangles can be built by adding the numbers of the
two preceding circles. In the same way the first row of the squares is
obtained from the two rows of triangles.</p>

<p>At the position of the white 91 a pyramid is located. The square
numbers 36 and 25 on square, 16 and 9 on triangular, and 4 and 1 on
round pieces add up to the total sum of 91 of the white
pyramid. Corresponding to this the black 190 is replaced by a pyramid
with the total sum 190, consisting of the square numbers 64 and 49 on
squares, 36 and 25 on triangles, and 16 on a circle. The pieces are
set up as illustrated in fig. 2. The tables of harmonies, in which all
combinations of pieces for harmonies are recorded, are very helpful in
playing. (2)</p>

<h3>B. The Aim of the Game</h3>

<p>Through tactical moves, the players should attempt to arrange a
harmony out of three or four pieces in a specific proportion in the
opponent's field. The players should however pay attention to the
opponent and prevent him from blocking his harmony. The first player
who arranges a harmony is the winner.</p>


<h3>C. The Moves of the Pieces</h3>

<p>The players move alternately into an empty space. No piece is allowed
to be jumped over. Black starts, because white has better
possibilities for capturing and arranging harmonies. This inequality
is a special attraction of Rithmomachia, because through this a
balanced playing is possible between unequal players.</p>

<p>The circles move into the second field, forwards, backwards or
sideways, but not diagonally. The triangles move into the third field,
only diagonally. The squares move into the fourth field, in all
directions (including diagonally). When moving, both the starting and
finishing field are counted. The 5 or 6 piece pyramids move according
to their individual components.</p>

<pre>***fig. 2: Board of Rithmomachia with the arrangement of the pieces at the beginning***
</pre>

<h3>D. The Capture of Pieces</h3>

<p>Pieces can capture others that stand in the way of their movement, but
they remain at their place and do not take the field of the opponent's
captured piece.</p>

<p>By meeting: If a piece is so placed, that in its next regular move it
could take the place of an opponent's piece with the same number, the
opponent's piece is taken away.</p>

<p>By ambush: If two or more pieces of ones party are in a position in
which in their next move they could move into the field of an
opponent's piece, and the sum or difference equals the number of the
opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is taken away.</p>

<p>By assault: If in its ordinary direction a piece could meet an
opponent piece, and its number equals by multiplication or by division
the number of fields between the two pieces, the opponent's piece is
taken away from the board. The fields of the capture and the captured
piece are counted.</p>

<p>By siege: If an opponent's piece is encircled by pieces of the other
party in such a way that it could neither move nor be set free by one
piece of its party, the besieged opponent's piece is taken away from
the board.</p>

<p>The individual components of the pyramids can both capture and be
captured. If single components are missing, the pyramids can be
captured by their total sum, but they cannot capture other pieces with
their total sum in this case. Partial sums are inadmissible.</p>


<h3>E. The Victory</h3>

<p>The game is finished, when one player has built up a harmony of three
or four pieces in the opponent's field. Therefore the pieces must be
arranged in an ascending row, in a right angle, or four pieces also in
a square, and must be equidistant. The captured opponent's pieces may
also be used in creating a harmony, however, they may not be the last
piece of a harmony. There are three ways of creating harmonies with
three pieces:</p>

<p>In an arithmetical harmony the difference between the two smaller
numbers equals the difference between the two bigger ones, e. g. 2, 4,
6 =&gt; b - a = c - b. A geometrical harmony exists, when the ratio between
the two smaller numbers equals the ratio between the two bigger ones,
e. g. 5, 10, 20 =&gt; (a / b) = (b / c). By the musical harmony the ratio
of the smallest and the biggest number equals the ration between the
difference of the two smaller numbers and of the two bigger ones,
e. g. 6, 8, 12 =&gt; (a / c) = [ (b - a) / (c - b) ]. To enable a rapid
game, the harmonies need not be calculated; rather, they can be looked
up in the tables of harmonies. Three different grades of victories can
be gained from different harmonies:</p>

<ul>
<li>A small victory is reached by an arithmetical, geometrical or musical
    harmony of three pieces.
</li><li>A big victory is gained by building two (but not more than two)
    different harmonies with 4 pieces.
</li><li>A great victory is reached by 4 pieces containing all three harmonies.
</li></ul>

<p>The players agree on which victory or victories they are aiming
for. It is possible to play with even simpler goals. If the players
desire a simpler game, a victory could be possible when a
predetermined number of opponent's pieces are captured, or a certain
sum or number of digits of the captured pieces is reached or exceeded.</p>

<p>The most essential features of Rithmomachia have been
represented. Because of the briefness some smaller details are
missing; but players can certainly work with this outline and work out
smaller details as necessary. A few variations of Rithmomachia have
been presented, which players can try.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, to play Rithmomachia today, one must build a game for
oneself, if one is not interested in using one of the two computer
games from Italy or from the USA. In the 16th century it was easier,
because the game could be bought in Paris and London, as Boissi?re and
Fulke/Lever wrote in their books on Rithmomachia. Presumably Jahn
(1929?) offered a set of the game for sale.</p>

<p>In the past treatises about Rithmomachia were published more often,
and it also appeared in game books. So there is still hope, that
Rithmomachia will be known better again. This desire was expressed in
the pseudo-ovidian poem 'De vetula' in the 13th century: 'Oh, if only
more people had enjoyed the battle of numbers! If it was only known,
it would on its own accord be highly respected.' Hopefully this wish,
that Rithmomachia be played again, will come true.</p>

<p>(1) This description of the rules is based for the most part on Illmer
(1987), who used the rules of Selenus (1616) as basis. There are some
differences in Stigter's version (199?). His rules include many
details with a good structure and the mathematical basis, they could
not be represented here because of the necessary briefness. It
contains a more extensive derivation of the numbers. More extended
descriptions of the rules of the Rithmomachia can be found in
Coughtrie (1984) and Richards (1946). In my master's thesis (1996) I
have also listed many different variations for playing.</p>

<p>(2) More extensive tables of harmonies can be found in Richards
(1946), Illmer (1987) and Mebben (1996).</p>
