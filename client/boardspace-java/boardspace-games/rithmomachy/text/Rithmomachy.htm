  <h1> Game of the Month: Rithmomachy </h1>
  <h2> by Dagonell the Juggler </h2>
</center>
<p>
Salaamallah the Corpulent, a Laurel for board games, says "Rithmomachy was 
invented to keep philosophers off the streets at night."  He may be right.
The game was invented in the 11th century and played throughout Europe during
the Middle Ages, but it was only played by those who considered themselves to
be well learned.
</p><p>
Several versions of the rules have survived.  Whether the variations are due 
to the game evolving over time, or extrapolation by the writers of the 
manuscripts is unknown.  What follows is a simplified compilation of the
various sets of rules.  For a complete set of all the rules, see Salaamallah's 
book, <u>Medieval Games</u>.
</p><p>
The board is eight squares wide and either fourteen or sixteen squares long.  
The easiest way to create a Rithmomachy board is to simply place two chess 
boards edge to edge.  The initial board set up is given in the diagram below.  
The pieces are either squares (S), triangles (T), or circles (C), painted 
white on one side and black on the other.  A captured piece may be turned over 
and used by the capturing side.  Additionally, each piece has a numerical value
which comes into play in the later stages of the game.
</p><p>
Each player also has one pyramid (P), a vertical stack of playing pieces.  
White has a pyramid worth 91 points: (36S, 25S, 16T, 9T, 4C, 1C).  Black has 
a pyramid worth 190 points: (64S, 49S, 36T, 25T, 16C).

Players alternate turns moving one piece per turn.  White goes first.  Circle 
pieces move exactly one square in any direction, horizontally, vertically or 
diagonally.  Triangle pieces move exactly two squares horizontally, vertically 
or diagonally.  Square pieces move exactly three squares horizontally, 
vertically or diagonally.  Pyramids move the same way as their bottom-most 
piece moves.  Pieces may not jump over other pieces, either their own or their 
opponents.  The path must be clear for the entire length of their move.  They 
may not shorten their move, but must move the entire distance they are allowed.
Pieces may not turn in mid-move but must continue in the direction they 
started.
</p><p>
There are four methods of capturing your opponent's pieces: assault, ambush, 
sally and siege.  In assault, a piece may capture and replace any piece of 
equal value occupying a square it can reach by a legal move.  In ambush, any
higher numbered piece adjacent to lower numbered enemy pieces whose sum or 
product were equal to it could be captured.  For example, 45S could be captured
by either 30T, 12T, &amp; 3C (sum) or 5C &amp; 9C (product).  In sally, a piece of 
value n which was x squares away from an enemy piece of value (x * n) captured 
and replaced it.  The distance must include both of the occupied squares.  For 
example, 8C can capture 16T by being adjacent to it (8 * 2 = 16).  In siege, a 
piece can be captured if it is surrounded on all sides by enemy pieces which 
are not in danger of being captured themselves.  A captured piece may be placed
on the capturing side's own back row as one of their own pieces in place of a 
move.
</p><p>
Pyramids attack and capture as either their total value or the value of their 
bases.  Pyramids may be captured by their total value, the value of their 
bases, one layer at a time, or the sum of several layers at a time.
</p><p>
There are eight possible ways to win, five lesser victories and three greater 
victories.  The first lesser victory, called De Corpore: capture the number of 
pieces which the players have agreed to beforehand.  The second lesser victory,
De Bonis: capture enough pieces whose value meets or exceeds a numerical total 
which the players have agreed to beforehand.  The third lesser victory, 
De Lite: capture pieces with a set number of digits which the players have 
agreed to beforehand.  For example, if the players agree to the digits 
1, 2, &amp; 3, White may win by capturing 12T &amp; 3C, or 120S &amp; 36T, or 225S &amp; 361S, 
etc.  The fourth lesser victory, De Honore: capture enough pieces to meet or 
exceed both a total number of pieces and a sum of their values which the 
players have agreed to beforehand.  The fifth lesser victory, Honore Liteque: 
the sum of the digits of the captured pieces must meet or exceed a numerical 
total which the players have agreed to beforehand.
</p><p>
The greater victories, or triumphs, require lining up at least three pieces in 
a arithmetical progression (e.g. 2C, 3C, &amp; 4C), a geometrical progression 
(e.g. 4C, 8C, &amp; 16C) or a harmonic progression, either late period (a/b = b/c) 
or early period (a/b = c/d).  A triumph cannot occur until the opponent's 
entire pyramid has been captured.  It doesn't matter if the opponent manages 
to re-capture any of the component pieces, because those re-captured men are 
now played as separate pieces and may not be re-assembled back into the
pyramid.  The Great Triumph: three pieces lined up to form one of the 
progressions.  The Greater Triumph: four pieces lined up to form two of the 
progressions simultaneously.  The Greatest Triumph: four pieces lined up on the
opponent's side of the board to form all three progressions simultaneously.
