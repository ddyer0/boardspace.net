/**
 * 
 * Overall Architecture
 * 
 * The site provides the lobby, choice game and opponents, communication between the players, information 
 * for spectators,  rankings, and a host of other services.  Each game has to be concerned only with 
 * the game itself.   An individual game (say, Hex) is launched and each client independently initializes
 * itself to a common starting state.   Thereafter each player specifies messages to be broadcast to the
 * other participants, and receives messages being broadcast by the other participants, which keep everyone
 * informed about the state of the game.  There is no common "true" state of the game - all the participants
 * keep in step by virtue of seeing the same stream of messages.    Messages are mostly simple "pick up a stone"
 * "place a stone on space x" and so on.
 * 
 * The things a game must implement are specified by the class "ViewerProtocol", and a game could just
 * start there and be implemented completely from scratch, but in practice there is another huge pile
 * of things that every game has to do; dealing with graphics, mouse events, saving and restoring the
 * game state from static records, replaying and reviewing games and so on.   These are implemented in the 
 * class "commonCanvas" and by several board-like base classes for hexagonal and square geometry boards.   
 * All the existing games for boardspace use these classes to provide graphics and basic board representation.
 * 
 * For games with robot players, there is another huge pile of things that a robot has to do, generating
 * moves, evaluating and choosing the best, and implementing a lookahead several moves deep.   There's a
 * standard framework for this using the "RobotProtocol" class and the "SearchDriver" class.

/**
 * 
 * This is intended to be maintained as the reference example how to interface to boardspace.
 * <p>
 * The overall structure here is a collection of classes specific to Hex, which extend
 * or use supporting online.game.* classes shared with the rest of the site.  The top level 
 * class is a Canvas which implements ViewerProtocol, which is created by the game manager.  
 * The game manager has very limited communication with this viewer class, but manages
 * all the error handling, communication, scoring, and general chatter necessary to make
 * the game part of the site.
 * <p>
 * The main classes are:
 * <br>HexGameViewer - this class, a canvas for display and mouse handling
 * <br>HexGameBoard - board representation and implementation of the game logic
 * <br>Hexmovespec - representation, parsing and printing of move specifiers
 * <br>HexPlay - a robot to play the game
 * <br>HexConstants - static constants shared by all of the above.  
 *  <p>
 *  The primary purpose of the HexGameViewer class is to do the actual
 *  drawing and to mediate the mouse gestures.  All the actual work is 
 *  done in an event loop, rather than in direct response to mouse or
 *  window events, so there is only one process involved.  With a single 
 *  process, there are no worries about synchronization among processes
 *  of lack of synchronization - both major causes of flakey user interfaces.
 *  <p>
 *  The actual mouse handling is done by the commonCanvas class, which simply 
 *  records the recent mouse activity, and triggers "MouseMotion" to be called
 *  while the main loop is executing.
 *  <p>
 *  Similarly, the actual "update" and "paint" methods for the canvas are handled
 *  by commonCanvas, which merely notes that a paint is needed and returns immediately.
 *  drawCanvas is called in the event loop.
 *  <p>
 *  The drawing methods here combine mouse handling and drawing in a slightly
 *  nonstandard way.  Most of the drawing routines also accept a "HitPoint" object
 *  which contains the coordinates of the mouse.   As objects are drawn, we notice
 *  if the current object contains the mouse point, and if so deposit a code for 
 *  the current object in the HitPoint.  the Graphics object for drawing can be null,
 *  in which case no drawing is actually done, but the mouse sensitivity is checked
 *  anyway.  This method of combining drawing with mouse sensitivity helps keep the
 *  mouse sensitivity accurate, because it is always in agreement with what is being
 *  drawn.
 *  <p>
 *  Steps to clone this hierarchy to start the next game
 *  <li> use eclipse refactor to rename the package for "hex" and for individual files
 *  <li> duplicate the hex start configuration, making a new one for the new game
 *  <li> launch the new game and get it to start, still identical to the old hex in all but name.
 *  	this will probably require a few edits to the init code.
 *  <li> do a cvs update on the original hex hierarchy to get back the original code.
 *

 * This is a good place to make notes about threads.  Threads in Java are
 * very dangerous and tend to lead to all kinds of undesirable and/or flakey
 * behavior.  The fundamental problem is that there are three or four sources
 * of events from different system-provided threads, and unless you are very
 * careful, these threads will all try to use and modify the same data
 * structures at the same time.   Java "synchronized" declarations are
 * hard to get right, resulting in synchronization locks, or lack of
 * synchronization where it is really needed.
 * <p>
 * This toolkit addresses this problem by adopting the "one thread" model,
 * and this is where it is.  Any other threads should do as little as possible,
 * mainly leave breadcrumbs that will be picked up by this thread.
 * <p>
 * In particular:
 * GUI events do not respond in the native thread.  Mouse movement and button
 * events are noted for later.  Requests to repaint the canvas are recorded but
 * not acted upon.
 * Network I/O events, merely queue the data for delivery later.
