	 * want to.  However, I do strongly encourage making a UI that is resizable within
	 * reasonable limits, and which has the main "board" object at the left.
	 * <p>
	 *  The basic layout technique used here is to start with a cell which is about the size
	 *  of a board square, and lay out all the other objects relative to the board or to one
	 *  another.  The rectangles don't all have to be on grid points, and don't have to
	 *  be non-overlapping, just so long as the result generally looks good.
	 *  <p>
	 *  When "extraactions" is available, a menu option "show rectangles" works
	 *  with the "addRect" mechanism to help visualize the layout.
