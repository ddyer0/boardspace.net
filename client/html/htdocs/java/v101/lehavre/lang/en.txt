# Feel free to edit this file to change the text displayed during the game.    #
# However, be careful with changing button texts. Some buttons do scale to     #
# their text size, others don't. So, if you happen to notice ill behavior,     #
# try to shorten your button text.                                             #
# Many of the texts and phrases given here have wildcard symbols: %s and %d.   #
# %s represents a string (text) that the wildcard will be replaced with in     #
# the game. %d represents a number. DO NOT delete or add any wildcards by      #
# yourself! Also, be sure to check what these wildcards represent if you       #
# like to change a phrase with wildcards.                                      #
# Some of the phrases contain HTML code. If you know how to write HTML code,   #
# feel free to change whatever you like, but DO NOT remove or add <html> tags. #
# Also note that Java only supports HTML 3.01 and just some of the basic CSS   #
# elements. You'll need to experminent a bit to receive best results.          #

mainInstructions
	<h1>The Main Window</h1>
	<p>The main window opens once the game initiator hits one of his two buttons.
	The starting player will be notified to do their move, now. But let us first see what
	elements we can find in the main window.</p>
	<h2>The Game Board</h2>
	<p>In the upper part of the main window you'll find the familiar <b>game board</b>.
	All <b>buildings</b> are stacked like in the board game and if you're playing the long game
	the back of a <b>special building</b> card can be seen in the proper place. The <b>supply
	tokens</b> and <b>round cards</b> are laid out.</p>
	<p>Let us look at the <b>offer spaces</b>: You can see a good on each of the offer spaces
	and a number underneath. The number tells you how many goods of that type are lying on the
	offer space. If there are no goods of that type, you'll see a 0 and the whole space is greyed
	out.</p>
	<p>You'll notice that the <b>supply spaces</b> are empty. They are not needed in the computer
	game. The game will do everything automatically as far as possible.</p>
	<h2>The Game Logo</h2>
	<p>There is the well-known Le Havre logo above the game board. If you right-click it, a context
	menu will be opened with 4 options. The first one allows you to create a savegame file. The next
	one opens a window with debug information. If you encounter a bug in the game, quickly open this
	debug window, copy and paste the text into a file and send it to my email address with further
	information on what you've done to get the bug. This will help to fix it.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, when playing online with other players, a weird bug may corrupt another player's
	game state. In this case, you should try to synchronize game states by selecting the third option
	of the logo context menu. This is an untested feature (you know, it's hard to cause bugs on purpose),
	so use it with caution.</p>
	<p>The last option opens a window with some general information about the game.</p>
	<h2>The Buttons</h2>
	<p>On and above the game board you'll notice some buttons. Above and below the round card are
	the two buttons to <b>finish</b> your turn or completely <b>redo</b> it (if you've messed up
	your move). They are greyed out if you can't use them and turn light orange as soon as they are
	available (after you've performed an action, for instance).</p>
	<p>Above the game board, you'll find 6 buttons on the right side, they are more important during
	the game. One of them opens the <b>Help Window</b> that you're currently reading. In case you've
	forgotten how to do something in the game, make sure you look it up here.</p>
	<p>Another button re-opens the <b>Chat Window</b> if you've closed it by accident. Please note, that
	the chat window opens itself whenever a message was received, either from another player or the system.</p>
	<p>Another button is quite useful during the game as it opens a window that lists all the buildings lying
	in the <b>Building Stacks</b>, so you can easily look them up with a quick glance. As everything in the
	window is rather tiny, you might want to check this information frequently before building. Usually,
	you need to put the mouse over a card to open a tooltip window that shows a much larger image of
	the card that is easily legible. Also, this popup window shows you the overall building costs of all
	the remaining buildings and their added-up prices for quick reference.</p>
	<p>The fourth button does the same as the previously described one, but for the ships within the
	<b>Ship Stacks</b>. It lists all the ships in the order they are lying in their stacks. As you can
	see just the topmost ship card on each stack during the game, it might be helpful to look here from
	time to time to know which other ships are lying in the stack underneath the topmost one.</p>
	<p>The last two buttons are fake buttons that just show you some information directly. One tells
	you the <b>Round</b> you're currently in and how many rounds will be played in total, the other one
	tells you whose <b>Turn</b> it is.</p>
	<p>There are a few more things to mention about the game board that might be pretty useful during
	the game. If you right-click any card or chit in the game you can choose <b><i>Details</i></b> from
	the displayed options to get all the information you need on the object in text format. If you hold
	the mouse over an element, a <b>Tooltip</b> opens a larger image (as mentioned above) for 5 seconds.
	The <b>Special Buildings</b> card, for instance, tells you how many special buildings are still in the
	stack, when the next one is due and whose turn it will be at the moment of construction.</p>
	<p>As long as there are standard buildings to be built during the game, you'll notice a small <b>Red
	Warning Triangle</b> on one of the buildings in the building stacks. This is the next building to be
	built by the town. Place the mouse over this icon to get further information like when this will
	happen and which player will be the first to be able to enter this building once it is built.</p>
	<h2>The Tabbed Sections</h2>
	<p>Below the game board there is a small area with tabs for the <b>Players</b> and the <b>Town</b>.
	Here you can switch between the tabs to see the cards and goods owned by a specific player as well
	as a lot of information on their game progress. The tabs are sorted by play order with the town tab
	being the first one.</p>
	<p>The town tab shows the <b>Overview Card</b> for the proper number of players and game type, so that
	you can easily check out the next round cards to come. Next to the overview card are all the buildings
	and ships in the town's possession in the order of their appearance.</p>
	<p>A player tab contains much more information. The next section describes in detail what you can find
	in any player's tab.</p>
	<h2>The Player Tabs</h2>
	<p>The player tab consists of six main parts. You'll find four of them at the top of the tab and the last
	two at the bottom. Please note, that each tab is painted in the player's color.</p>
	<p>At the top of the player tab are these four sections: the buttery, the goods panel, the
	information panel and the loan card. The <b>Buttery</b> holds a ship token that shows the number of food
	you're getting from all of your ships at the end of a round. During the game you might notice a big
	<b>Yellow Warning Triangle</b> here that indicates that you've got less food than needed at the end of
	the current round. This symbol disappears once you've got enough food and reappears whenever this state
	changes. Of course, it includes all available sources of food: food from your ships, food from your goods
	and your current cash.</p>
	<p>Next to the buttery there is the <b>Goods Panel</b>. It shows all of the 16 available goods in the game,
	the 8 basic ones and their 8 upgraded versions. A number below a good tells you how many goods you own
	of that type. Good and number are greyed out if you don't own any chits of the specific type. You won't find
	your francs here. Cash is displayed in the next section.</p>
	<p>The <b>Information Panel</b> gives you some useful information on your game progress. Firstly, it shows
	you how many ships of each type there are in your possession for a quick reference, and it sums up their
	shipping capacities (to ship goods on the Shipping Line). Next to it you'll find information on your overall
	cash (francs), food (sum of all food values of your goods) and energy (sum of all energy values of your goods).</p>
	<p>If the option to view the victory points is set (this can be done in the Settings Window before the game starts),
	you'll see them below the information mentioned above.
	Regardless of this, the total number of turns you've got before the game ends is displayed. Please note,
	this number does not include your current turn if it's your turn. It does, however, include the final action.</p>
	<p>At the right hand side of the information panel you'll finally find a <b>Craft</b>, <b>Hammer</b> and
	<b>Fishing</b> symbol and numbers next to them. They tell you, how many of these symbols you own. The game
	does not, however, count the other building symbols as they are only used on bonus buildings.</p>
	<p>Finally, the top row of a player tab shows a <b>Loan Card</b>. It tells you how many loans you have and
	gives you information on payback and the penalty if you don't pay them back in its tooltip. Right-click the
	card to pay back some or all loans. This is, by the way, done automatically by the game at the end of it.
	If you have no loans, the card is greyed out.</p>
	<p>Now, let us look at the final two sections of the player tab. Below the buttery card there is the
	<b>Ships Panel</b> that will hold all of your ship cards you'll own. They will be placed staggered like
	in the building stacks to save space. Their amounts will be displayed in the information panel anyway,
	so this doesn't hurt.</p>
	<p>Finally, next to the ships panel, there is the <b>Buildings Panel</b>. It holds all of your buildings
	in a specific order. 8 buildings fit into one row, so if you own more than 8, you'll need to scroll down
	to see the other ones. The order they're sorted is the following: the starting buildings (B1, B2 and B3)
	will always be placed first. All enterable special buildings will be placed next to them in the order of
	their numbers (highest number first). Next to them, you'll find your enterable standard buildings in the
	order of their numbers. Finally, the non-enterable buildings are placed at the end of the list. This order
	will suit most purposes as you'll want to use higher numbered buildings later in the game, and preferrably
	the special buildings over the standard ones.</p>
	<h1>The Game Components in Detail</h1>
	<p>In this section I will talk about the various game components you know from the board game and what you
	can do with them in the computer game.</p>
	<h2>The Supply Tokens</h2>
	<p>The supply tokens are placed on the appropriate spaces on the game board at the beginning of the game.
	They will be revealed during the first round and stay where they are unvealed during the rest of the game.
	Place the mouse over one of them to view a bigger version of the image. Right-click the chit to open the
	context menu and choose the details option. It'll open a popup window that tells you what you can see on
	the supply token. The players' ship markers will be placed on the supply chits when the game progresses
	and moved automatically from turn to turn. Hold the mouse over a ship token to view its owner.</p>
	<h2>The Goods Chits</h2>
	<p>You can find goods chits on various places in the game. They lay out on the offer spaces and in the
	goods panel of each player. But they may also appear in various dialog windows during the game. Hold
	the mouse over a chit to view a bigger version of it. Right-click the chit and choose <i>Details</i>
	to get the information on the chit in text format. The goods on the offer spaces additionally show the
	<i>Take</i> option in their context menus. Choose it if it's your turn and you wish to take an offer.
	Alternatively, double-click the offered good chit to take the offer.</p>
	<h2>The Round Card</h2>
	<p>The round card shows information about the end of the current round. It tells you how many food you need to pay,
	if there is a harvest, and which (if any) building will be built next. The appropriate line is marked with
	a thick black border to help you find it more easily (as I use the original cards). Hold the mouse over
	the card to see a bigger version or choose "details" from the context menu for the information in text
	format.</p>
	<h2>The Special Building Card</h2>
	<p>This card does not have any purpose. It just tells you how many special buildings are still in the
	stack. If you play the short game, you won't see this card.</p>
	<h2>Buildings and Ships</h2>
	<p>Buildings and ships both show bigger versions of their image if you hold the mouse over them.
	The <i>Details</i> option from their context menu describes the card in text format. Another option
	from the context menu allows you to sell and buy them. You can sell cards you own at any time, even
	if it's not your turn.</p>
	<p>To build a building or ship you need to enter the appropriate building. Afterwards a symbol appears
	on all the cards you are able to build. Double-click the card to build it or choose the appropriate context menu
	option.</p>
	<p>Most buildings can be entered as your main action. Double-click the building you want to enter or
	choose the appropriate context menu option. If you can't use this building or pay the entry, an error
	message will notify you about this fact. It won't tell you any specifics, though. In this case, choose
	another building to use.</p>
	<p>If you have a building that allows you to ban people from buildings, another option appears in the
	context menu of each building where there is another player. Choose it to perform the ban.</p>
	<p>A last context menu option displays the player who is currently using/blocking this building. Some
	special buildings work differently, like the Construction Site that shows you your handcards.</p>
	<h2>The Red Warning Triangle</h2>
	<p>I've described this triangle in the beginning of the tutorial. It is displayed as long as there
	are buildings in the building stacks that will be built by the town. Hold the mouse over the symbol
	to get further information on when this happens and who will be the first to profit from it.</p>
	<h2>The Buttery</h2>
	<p>The buttery is meaningless. The round ship token on it is more useful as it shows you the amount
	of food you get from your ships at the end of each round. If this number is greater than 0, a tooltip
	will explicitly give you this information.</p>
	<h2>The Yellow Warning Triangle</h2>
	<p>It appears whenever your overall food is lower than needed at the end of the current round and
	vanishes as soon as you've got enough food. Read the description of the player tabs to get further
	information.</p>
	<h1>The Game Flow</h1>
	<p>If it's your turn, a <b>Popup Window</b> will appear and notify you unless you're playing solo.
	Sometimes it might happen to you that you clicked somewhere in the window exactly at the time the
	popup window pops up. This might cause the window to minimize and block any mouse controls. This is
	no error in the game, but rather a problem with your operating system. Just open the popup window by
	clicking on it in the taskbar and close it by hitting its button.</p>
	<p>After you've closed the popup window, you can either take an offer by double-clicking it or enter
	a building by also double-clicking it. Navigate through the tabs to find the building you want to
	enter. In-between you're free to buy and sell your items.</p>
	<p>Once you've done an action, the <b>Redo Button</b> above the round card is activated. Please be
	careful with performing your action and take the time you need to think it over. Try to use the redo
	button as little as possible as it undoes your entire turn and any actions other players did
	simultaneously (paying back loans, selling buildings). Also, the interest payment needs to be
	redone if it was due this turn. However, of course, you won't pay the interest twice. It's more
	that the entire game state will be reset to the state before your turn and so anything that happened
	during your turn must be redone.</p>
	<p>After you've performed the main action of your turn, the <b>Continue Button</b> is activated.
	You need to press it to finish your turn and pass it to the next player. Whenever nothing happens
	during the game, make sure you've hit the continue button if it was your turn.</p>
	<p>Everything you do in your turn will be displayed in the <b>Chat Window</b> to notify all players
	about your moves. This makes it much easier to follow the game. System messages like this will be
	displayed in blue whereas any messages you write will appear red in your chat window and black in
	any other player's window. So, it's no problem to follow the game and the chat between the players.</p>
	<h2>Interest Payment</h2>
	<p>Once in seven turns every player who owns one or more loans will need to pay the interest.
	The game halts at this moment and asks the involved players to make the payment. At this moment,
	you can minimize the payment window and sell items to get cash. Pay back all of your loans to
	avoid the interest payment or collect cash to pay it. Anyway, if you hit the button in the
	payment window, the game performs the payment if you still own at least one loan. If you don't
	have any money to pay, you'll get another loan automatically.</p>
	<h2>Round End</h2>
	<p>The current round ends after seven turns and each player needs to pay the food demand.
	Players who have enough food provided by their ships need not to do anything now. All the
	other players get a payment window and need to enter the goods they want to pay with. You
	can sell items prior to finalizing the payment like during interest payments. If you've got
	less food in goods than needed, you need not to enter anything if you want to pay the rest
	with francs. Just hit the button - the game asks you in this case if you like to pay all
	goods with food values and pay the rest with francs. Hit OK to do it or cancel if you want
	to pay differently (like saving some goods and paying more francs).</p>
	<p>After all players are done, the next round begins. A new ship enters the game and is
	placed on top of the appropriate stack. If there was a harvest, each player matching the
	conditions get their harvested goods. If there is a building to be built, the town gets the
	appropriate building card.</p>
	<h2>The Final Action Phase</h2>
	<p>The final action phase begins after the last round card was evaluated. Each player now has
	one final action and can enter any building except the one they're already in. No goods are
	added to the offer spaces any more, but you can still take them as your final action. Items
	still can be sold, but not purchased as per the rules. After everybody's done with their
	final action, the game ends and the scoring window appears. This will be described later.</p>
	<h1>Entering Buildings</h1>
	<p>Whenever you enter a building the game checks if you're able to pay the entry fee.
	If yes, it then checks if you are able to perform the action. You can't enter a building
	unless you can use it.</p>
	<h2>The Entry Dialog</h2>
	<p>If you need to pay an entry fee, the game first checks if the payment is clear, ie.
	if there is just one way to pay it. In this case, the game performs the payment automatically.
	Otherwise, an entry payment dialog opens and you need to specify how to pay the entry fee.
	You can't overpay in the sense that you freely give more goods than needed, but, of course,
	you may overpay like 1 meat if only 1-2 food was asked.</p>
	<p>After this, you enter the building. If the building has a unique function, it will be
	performed automatically, like getting 1 wood, 1 brick and 1 iron in the Hardware Store.
	Buildings that ask you to pay or choose goods will be described in the next sections.
	Finally, there are some very special buildings that work differently. These won't be
	described here as they are very intuitive.</p>
	<h2>The Process Dialog</h2>
	<p>Process dialogs show up if you enter a building like the Bakehouse, where you need to
	input some goods to get other goods as output. As there always is a unique way to process
	such goods, the dialog consists of the following elements: A description tells you which
	goods you need to put in and which ones you'll get out. It won't mention energy or other
	costs as they are shown on the card and you could've checked prior to entering the building.
	Below the description there is an input box and a number in brackets next to it. The number
	tells you how many "packages" of goods you can throw in. Enter the number of packages you
	want to put in or leave this box empty if you want to throw in as much as possible (the
	number in the brackets). Hit the button once you've entered the information (or not). The
	game now processes your goods. In case you can only process one package, the game won't
	popup the dialog, but process this one package, immediately.</p>
	<h2>The Choice Dialog</h2>
	<p>Choice dialogs appear whenever a building asks you to choose goods you want to get or
	discard, like in the Marketplace. Only the available goods are displayed and a number in
	brackets tells you how many of this type of good there is to choose from. The description
	informs you of hthe minimum and maximum number of goods you need to choose. Enter the
	numbers in the appropriate input boxes and hit the button. There is no way to speed up
	this process as in process dialogs.</p>
	<p>Some special buildings use the choice dialog rather than a process dialog like the Coal
	Trader and Junkyard. Thus, it's not possible to get the full possible load by leaving the
	input boxes empty.</p>
	<h2>The Energy Dialog</h2>
	<p>An energy dialog pops up if you need to pay energy for the current action. Like in the
	food dialog at the end of the round, enter the goods you want to pay with and hit the button.
	If there is only one way to pay, the game does it itself and doesn't pop up a dialog window.</p>
	<h2>The Food Dialog</h2>
	<p>Please do not confuse these with those that pop up at the end of a round. Food dialogs may
	pop up like energy dialogs whenever an action requires you to pay food like a visit to the
	Coal Trader or Junkyard. Again, if there's only one way to pay, the game automatically pays
	this way and doesn't open the dialog.</p>
	<h2>The Marketplace</h2>
	<p>In the long game, if you enter the Marketplace you get to see the two topmost special
	buildings lying on the special buildings stack. These will be displayed only if the game
	still is to build any special buildings. In this case a special dialog window pops up that
	shows you the two buildings and lets you choose which one to place on top. It also informs
	you which players will be the first to use these buildings once they are built. Double-click
	on the building you want to be on top or hit the button if you're content with their order.
	The left one will be on top, the right one underneath.</p>
	<h2>The Shipping Line</h2>
	<p>Due to performance this building is slightly counter-intuitive, therefore I need to
	describe its functionality here. If you enter the Shipping Line you'll get a normal choice
	dialog first that asks you to choose the goods you want to ship. However, you'll notice it
	shows all of your goods, even those you might want to use to pay the energy cost. The game
	won't predict which goods you might want to use for energy. Therefore keep track for yourself
	which goods you want to pay the energy costs with.</p>
	<p>However, the description gives you a hint, how many energy is needed for all possible
	shipments. Of course, once you've entered the numbers and hit the button, the game checks
	if you're able to pay this shipment. If not, you'll get an error message and need to correct
	your input. If everything is OK with your shipment, the energy dialog pops up if needed and
	you'll need to pay the energy cost, now.</p>
	<p>All the other buildings are rather intuitive. Read their descriptions carefully to
	use them properly.</p>
	<h1>The Scoring Window</h1>
	<p>Once the game is over, the scoring window pops up to show you the final scores.
	It names the winner(s) and their winning score and lists all players and a complete
	summary of their achievements divided in: victory points through cash, ships, buildings
	and their bonuses, and minuses through unpaid loans. Please note, that there is no way
	to transfer this data to a public server for any kind of rankings.</p>
	<p>The window shows two buttons. The right one quits the game, the left one was planned
	to start another session. However, I haven't bothered to implement this feature, so
	ignore this fake button.</p>

loginInstructions
	<h1>The Login Window</h1>
	<p>This window consists of three elements:</p>
	<ul><li>the menu bar</li><li>the logo image</li><li>the login area</li></ul>
	<p>Here is a short description of these elements.</p>
	<h2>Choice of Language</h2>
	<p>You'll find the available languages in the language menu. They are read
	automatically from the language file folder. If you change the language, the
	game restarts, because the language data needs to be read again. This is the
	reason why you can't change the language once you've logged into the game.
	So choose carefully when selecting the language before you start the game.</p>
	<h2>The Login Area</h2>
	<p>The login area consists of four parts:</p>
	<ul><li>input field for the name of the game</li>
	<li>input field for a preset IP address</li>
	<li>input field for the player's name</li>
	<li>two buttons</li></ul>
	<p>The data you enter here will be saved on your computer and read the next time
	you open the game. Please note, however, that if you start a parallel game with
	other data on the same computer, the data will be overwritten by the second instance
	of the game. This won't affect the running games, but you'll need to enter the data
	you wish again next time you create a game.
	<h2>The Name of the Game</h2>
	<p>You can enter any name here with some restrictions that are mentioned below.
	If there is already a game with this name created in your local area network, you'll
	join this game and will be able to take part. There is no way to just watch a game,
	however. If the game has already been started or if there are already the maximum
	number of players logged into the game, you can't enter.</p>
	<p>If there is no game with this name, it will be created automatically and your
	opponents will be able to join you. They just need to enter the same name for their
	game. The default name is 'Le Havre', but you can change it to whatever fits your
	taste.</p>
	<p>You don't need a network running to play <b>Le Havre</b>. If you want to play a
	multiplayer game on the same computer, just start the game multiple times. Please note,
	however, that the game will be running in multiple windows and you'll need to organize
	them yourself.</p>
	<h2>The Preset IP Address</h2>
	<p>Usually, you won't need to enter a value here and may leave this field blank.
	If your computer supports multiple networks, however, it might be necessary to enter
	your LAN IP address manually into this field to ensure that the computers will find
	each other. You'll know that you failed to connect with other players if you're the
	only one in the Lobby Window. Please consult the internet or a more experienced player
	to learn how to get your IP address.</p>
	<p>If you want to play over the internet via <b>Hamachi</b>, you need to enter your
	Hamachi IP address here to get a game running. Please note, there have been multiple
	problems with Hamachi if you've got a WLAN connection to the internet. Such problems
	may occur in the middle of the game and there is no way to fix them. This is a problem
	with Hamachi only and not the game itself.</p>
	<h2>The Player's Name</h2>
	<p>You can choose any name to represent yourself in the game. There are only a few
	restrictions mentioned below. Although technically possible, I wouldn't recommend
	two players using the same username.</p>
	<h2>Restrictions on Names</h2>
	<p>You can enter any names that follow these restrictions:</p>
	<ul><li>It may not be longer than 20 characters.</li>
	<li>You may not use any characters other than letters, numbers, underscore, blank and minus.</li></ul>
	<p>If you don't follow these restrictions, you'll get an error message when you try to
	log into the game. If you get such an error message and you've loaded a savegame, you
	won't need to load the savegame again.</p>
	<h2>The Buttons</h2>
	<p>At the bottom of the window you'll find two buttons. The left one allows you to
	<b>load a savegame</b> and continue the saved game. The right button <b>logs you into the game</b>.
	If there is a game with the given name already created, you'll join it. If you load a savegame
	or if you enter a running game where a player is missing, you'll be asked to select your seat
	and continue the game.</p>
	<p><b>Please note!</b> You can't load a savegame if there is a game currently running under
	the same name. In this case you'll join the running game rather than the savegame.</p>

	<h1>The Lobby Window</h1>
	<p>This window consists of three elements:</p>
	<ul><li>Game Menu</li><li>Lobby Area</li><li>Start Buttons</li></ul>
	<p>Surely, you've noticed that along with this window another one has been openened.
	This window is the chat window and will be explained at the bottom of this page.</p>
	<h2>The Game Menu</h2>
	<p>This menu allows you to change the settings of the game. These are the game elements
	that can be changed in the <b>Settings Window</b>:</p>
	<ul><li>You can change the order of the <b style="color:green;">Supply Tokens</b>
	partly or entirely. Also, you can set some of the tokens to be visible from start.</li>
	<li>Then, you can ban certain or all of the <b style="color:green;">Special Buildings</b>.
	Also, you can set their position within the special buildings stack, or use some of them
	as additional start buildings.</li>
	<li>Further, you can define which building stack certain <b style="color:green;">Standard
	Buildings</b> will be placed in. Within these, they will be ordered according to the rules.</li>
	<li>Another possible setting is to change the amount of <b style="color:green;">Goods</b>
	displayed at the beginning of the game. If you do not enter any value at specific goods,
	they will be laid out in the default amount defined in the rules.</li>
	<li>A last thing you can change is the maximum amount of goods you'll get from a visit of
	the Marketplace in the <b style="color:green;">Solo Game</b>. Also, if you wish to always
	see the current victory points of each player, check the apporpriate box.</li>
	<p>You can save the settings to a file and re-use them in future games. Please note, however,
	if you load the settings from a file, they only will be displayed in the editor at first.
	To actually use them you need to hit the <b>Apply</b> button.</p>
	<p><b>Attention!</b> Only the first player that logged into the game can perform changes
	on the settings. Use the chat window to discuss any changes so that everyone agrees upon them.</p>
	<h2>The Lobby Area</h2>
	<p>Here you can see who has already joined the game. Each player will be displayed in a single
	line. Such a line consists of the following elements:</p>
	<ul><li>The Seat Position</li><li>The Player's Name</li><li>The Player's Color</li>
	<li>A Button for Additional Goods</li></ul>
	<p>Only the game initiator will be able to change these values.</p>
	<h3>The Seat Position</h3>
	<p>You can preset the play order by selecting a seat position for every player.
	Use the chat to discuss a preferred play order or let the game randomly decide it.</p>
	<p>A <b>?</b> is used to assign a random position to a given player. The game will then
	assign the preset positions first and then randomly place the remaining players.</p>
	<p>If you assign the same seat number for two or more players, the order between them
	will be determined randomly. Note, however, that this order will have a higher priority
	than all of the '?'.</p>
	<p>Don't worry about selecting a seat number that doesn't exist (like seat 5 with 3 players).
	These players will be positioned correctly at the end of the play order.</p>
	<h3>The Player Color</h3>
	<p>As anything in the lobby window, the player color also can only be changed by the
	game initiator. Use the chat to tell him which color you prefer. However, you can't assign
	the same color to more than one player, or you'll get an error message if you try to start
	the game. Only after all colors have been properly set, you can start the game.</p>
	<h3>Additional Goods</h3>
	<p>Usually, you won't need to set additional goods, but you can if you like start with more or
	less than usual if you play with unexperienced players. Leave a field blank if you don't want
	to change its default value. Enter a 0 explicitely, if you don't want to get this good.</p>
	<p>As with everything, only the game initiator can perform these changes and should discuss
	them via the chat window with the other players. In any case, all players will be informed
	by the system about any changes the game initiator does in the lobby.</p>
	<h2>The Start Buttons</h2>
	<p>There are two buttons to start the game. Use the left one to start a <b style="color:navy;">Long
	Game</b> and the right one to start <b style="color:navy;">Short Game</b>. However, only the game
	initiator will see these buttons. Every other player has only one button to notify the game initiator
	that he's ready to start. Every player needs to hit this button before the game initiator can start
	the game.</p>
	<p>Again, use the chat window to agree upon a type of game and let the game initiator start it
	by hitting the appropriate button.</p>
	<h1>The Chat Window</h1>
	<p>The chat window opens automatically when logging into the game and whenever a message
	comes in. You can close it if you like and re-open through the game menu. It is used to
	enable the players to communicate with each other during the game, as well as display
	system messages like what a player currently does (like which building he enters).</p>
	<p>New messages will be added to the end of the chat window and it'll scroll automatically to
	the newest message. Also, the messages are color coded. You'll see your own messages in red,
	other players' messages in black and system notifications in blue.</p>
	<p>The chat window doesn't have any special abilities. There are no implemented smilies or
	special commands but the one you probably know from <b>Brettspielwelt</b> that allows you to
	suppress the colon. Start your message with a colon to do so.</p>

about
	<h1>About JLeHavre...</h1>
	<p>The work on the computer version of the great board game <b>Le Havre</b> by successful
	designer <b>Uwe Rosenberg</b> (Agricola, Bohnanza) started on January&nbsp;7th, 2009 and
	went on until end of March. It was solely done by <b>Grzegorz Kobiela</b> from Hanover,
	Germany.</p>
	<p>All rights on the graphics and the board game are reserved to their proper owners.
	The programmer has got the explicit approval of the respective rights-holders to publish
	this project and to use the original graphics.</p>
	<p>The duplication and distribution of parts of or the whole game are prohibited.
	The rights of the respective rights-holders must be preserved.</p>
	<h1>Programming</h2>
	<p>The computer version of <b>Le Havre</b> was written in the programming language <b>Java</b>
	(version 1.6). The network communication is based on <b>JGroups</b>, a class library designed
	by a third party to help with network projects in Java. The stability of the game offline and online is
	mainly based on their library.</p>
	<p>This version of the computer game is final and I won't continue the work on it. Meanwhile,
	I'm creating another version from scratch and hope to make it more stable and better than this one,
	and hopefully it'll have artificial intelligence, i.&nbsp;e. computer players. I strongly apologize
	for any bugs and other problems you might encounter with the game. I do know that there might be
	occasional memory leaks.</p>
	<h1>Acknowledgments</h2>
	<p>First of all I want to thank the ingenious designer of this tremendous board game, <b>Uwe Rosenberg</b>,
	for his approval of this project, but above all I'm very grateful for his great support! Next I want to
	thank Hanno Girke from Lookout Games for his OK, and Klemens Franz for his excellent graphic design,
	his approval to use it and support. Finally, I want to thank <u>all</u> of my playtesters, namely Markus Tong,
	Bo Link, Jake Duffy, BGG user dreadpirate, Rogrio Pereira, Zach Carter and Phil Sauer. I apologize to all
	of those of you who haven't been named here. I didn't keep track of my playtesters, so I may have forgotten
	some of you. I'm so sorry! I could only name those who answered me through boardgamegeek. So, if you weren't
	named here, but would like to (as you deserve it!), please contact me and I'll add you here. You'll find my
	email address below.</p>
	<p>Also, great thanks to Micheal Murphy for checking the English language file.</p>
	<h1>Support</h1>
	<p>I kindly ask everyone who is willing for a small donation. This first version of the computer game is
	100% free and nobody needs to pay me for my work. However, if you love this computer version  and if you want to
	compensate my effort, please send a little money via PayPal to <b>grzesieczek@gmx.de</b>. Your donations
	will give me motivation to continue programming. That said, I'd like to thank to all of those who have already
	made a donation: Doug Bass, Isaac, Jan Brockmann, Markus Ellenberger, Michael Nosiara und Robert Trezise.</p>
	<p>This email address is also my contact address if you have any questions or suggestions. Also, you can
	contact me via Boardgamegeek at any time under the user name <b>Ponton</b>.</p>
	<h1>A Last Plea</h1>
	<p>This project would never exist if there wasn't the outstanding work of designer <b>Uwe Rosenberg</b> and
	his marvelous board game <b>Le Havre</b>. Therefore I ask everyone who loves to play this computer version
	to also consider the purchase of the original board game! This way you can express your gratitude for this
	great game to its designer and encourage him to design further ingenious games in the future. This way you
	do yourself a favor when there will be the next great Rosenberg game.</p>
	<p>Also: Is there anything better than sitting with friends at the table and having a relaxed session of
	<b>Le Havre</b> and other board games? Where else will you get to laugh about the expression on your opponent's
	face if you make a perfect move, or will you see red if your opponent crushes you!</p>
	<p>Finally, I wish all of you a lot of fun with this game!</p>
