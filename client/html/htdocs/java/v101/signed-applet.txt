Signed applet based on http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/Programming/JDCBook/signed.html

My key generation:

	keytool -genkey -alias signFiles -keystore compstore -keypass bsKeyPassword -dname "cn=Boardspace" -storepass bSpassword



keytool -export -keystore compstore -storepass bSpassword -alias signFiles -file Boardspace.cer

jarsigner -keystore compstore -storepass bSpassword -keypass bsKeyPassword -signedjar OnlineLobby.jar OnlineLobby-unsigned.jar signFiles

Adding this signing to the applet causes scary looking warnings about security and untrusted sources.
