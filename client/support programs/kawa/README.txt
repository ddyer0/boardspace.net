Kawa was one of the very first Java IDEs, and the first to support source
level debugging.   It's long dead, but for historical reasons it's still
the script I use to build java apps for export.  It could all be replaced
by an ant or mavin script.

Kawa installer says it can't install, but the copied version
still runs.  Yea!.   To register it, use 
key "Dave Dyer" "I@FC" without the quotes
