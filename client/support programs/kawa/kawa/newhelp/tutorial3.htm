<h3><font color=brown>Creating Packages under Kawa</font></h3>
<p>
In this tutorial we will learn how to make packages using Java. Packages under Java are like namespaces and 
it is used to group class files into different namespaces based on the functionality, author etc.. Please select
Project/Open and open the DrawTest project we created in <a href="tutorial1.htm">tutorial 1</a>.
<ul>
	<li>In order to create a package it is necessary to add a pacakage line to all the source files which are part
	of a given package. For this example, we will create a package called "tutorial3.test"
	</li>
	<li>Please double click on DrawTest.java file to open the file in Kawa editor. Please add a line "package tutorial3.test;"
	as the first non-commented line in the source file. It is important that the package line is the first valid source line
	in any source file. Select File/Save to save the file.</li>
	<li>Without setting a compiler output directory, Kawa will create the class file in the same directory as the source file.
	However, when you create packages it is important to provide an output directory.</li>
	<li>Please select Project/Compiler options... menu option and set the compiler output directory to project directory. This can
	be done by setting the compiler output directory value as "<project directory>" or "." for current directory. Please refer to
	<a href="tutorial2.htm">tutorial 2</a> for more details on setting compiler output directory.</li>
	<li>Before we build this project we can delete all the old class files from DrawTest folder. This is optional. Select Build/Rebuild all
	to create all the class files under the folder /tutorial3/test.</li>
	<li>In order to run this project as an application, please select DrawTest.java as the main class file and select Build/Run to run the
	application. Please note in the output directory that the class name is now tutorial3.test.DrawTest</li>
	<li>In order to run this project as an applet we have to make a small change in the example1.html file. Remember our class name is now
	<b>tutorial3.test.DrawTest</b> and not just <b>DrawTest</b>. Double click on example1.html file and find the line which says "code=Drawtest.class" and
	change the line to read "code=tutorial3.test.DrawTest.class" and save the file.</li>
	<li>Select example1.html as the main HTML file and select Build/Run to run this project as an applet this time</li>
</ul>
With this tutorial we now have learnt how to create packages under Kawa.
