<p>The file item icon and the folder icon is more than just a
cute image in the Kawa project tree. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="dirtyfiles.gif" width="301"
height="210"></p>

<p>As shown in the figure above if the file item is red in
color it indicates that the file is dirty and it needs compiling.
Conversely, if the file item is green it indicates that the file
is clean. Similarly, if a closed sub-folder has a check mark sign
as shown in the figure above it indicates that the sub-folder has
all clean files under it and if the folder has a cross mark it
indicates that the sub-folder has some dirty files under it. </p>

<p>These indicators are updated when a file is saved or
compiled, after Build/Rebuild All command, Build/Compile *.java
command, Rebuild Folder command and Compile *.java folder
command. It is possible for the indicators to not indicate
correctly some times. Selecting Updates Images from the Project
item right button menu in the project tree will update all the
images. </p>
