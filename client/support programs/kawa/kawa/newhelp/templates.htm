<B><P>Now it is possible to drag classes from any file in the project tree into the editor. When you do this Kawa reads the class information and displays a dialog box with the option to change the name of the class being copied as shown in the figure below -</B> </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="templates.gif" WIDTH=716 HEIGHT=506></P>
<B><P>If the name of the class is changed then the class is copied along with the entire class content with the new name. Also, the constructor name is changed automatically to the new name if a constructor is found in the dragged class.</B> </P>
<B><P>In the example shown above, a template frame class is defined with appropriate interfaces already defined and the standard frame menus already defined in the class. This class is copied to make new classes in different projects very quickly. This is a quick way of making new classes from template or skeleton classes. This paradigm can be extended to make different classes with different functionality. In future versions of Kawa it will be possible to pick the class methods that will be copied and also any Javadoc comments for the class can be copied optionally.</B> </P></BODY>
