Setting alternate compilers and VMs is a breeze with the new inteface. Please select Customize/Options menu option
and select Advanced Paths under Profiles. This will display a dialog as shown below.

<p>
By default, the compiler path is set to javac.exe in your Java bin directory. Kawa automatically sets this path everytime you
set the java bin path. The same is true for interpreter path and appletviewer path. However, you can set the compiler or the
interpreter to a different executable by clicking on ">>" button next to the respective field and adding the path to the new
executable.

<p>
For example, if you want to set the compiler to IBM's jikes.exe, first select jikes.exe as the new compiler in the select compiler
dialog and add " +E" after the path in the edit box as shown above. Click on update to update the list. Back in the advanced paths
dialog select the newly added compiler as the current compiler for the active profile.
<p>
Please follow the same to set a different VM other than java.exe/
