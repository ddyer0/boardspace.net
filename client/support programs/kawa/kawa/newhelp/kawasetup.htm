<P>Kawa is a thin layer on JDK and therefore it is necessary to install JDK prior to using Kawa. 
Since Kawa is JDK version independent it can work with any version of JDK beginning with 1.02 to the 
latest 1.2. Please download the latest version of JDK from <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/">JavaSoft</a> 
site and select the appropriate JDK section below and follow the instructions under the section to 
install Kawa properly.
<p>
<font color=brown><h2>JDK 1.0.2 or JDK 1.1.x</h2></font>
	<UL>
	<li>Install the appropriate version of JDK and start Kawa. If Kawa warns you about JDK bin path not
	being set ignore the warning and go to Customize/Options dialog. Kawa should automatically take you
	to this dialog after the warning message. In case it does not, please select Customize/Options from 
	the menu to display the dialog.
	</li><br><br>	
	<li>Please set the Java bin directory under the JDK paths tab to point to JDK/bin directory. Click
	on the button ">>" to set this value. Kawa will automatically set the Java lib directory for you based
	on the bin path.
	</li><br><br>	
	<li>Please set the Java source directory to JDK/src directory if you elected to install source during
	JDK installation.
	</li><br><br>	
	<li>Please select Kawa paths tab under Customize/Options dialog and set the JDK package index file to point to
	kawa.pkg located in the Kawa installation directory.
	</li><br><br>	
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	<i>Please follow these additional steps to setup JDK help documents under Kawa.</i>
	<p>
	
	<ul>
	</li>
	<li>Please download the appropriate JDK HTML Windows Zip documentation from the <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/">JavaSoft</a>
	web site and unzip the contents to JDK/docs directory.
	</li><br><br>	
	<li>Please set the Java documents directory under Customize/Options/JDK Paths to point to the above docs
	directory. The docs directory is the one which has the api folder under it.
	</li><br><br>	
	<li>Please select Kawa paths tab under Customize/Options dialog and set the help index file to point to
	kawa.ipg located under Kawa installation directory.
	</li><br><br>	
	</ul>
	
After you complete the above steps you should be able to compile and run java programs under JDK 1.1 and also be
able to access context sensitive help for JDK keywords by pressing F1 key in the editor on any JDK keyword.
<p>
<font color=brown><h2>JDK 1.1.x with Swing</h2></font>
	<ul>
	<li>Please follow the above steps to install JDK 1.1 support for Kawa.
	</li><br><br>
	<li>Please download Swing 1.1 for JDK 1.1 from <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/">JavaSoft</a>
	web site and install Swing on your computer.
	</li><br><br>
	<li>Since the standard version of Kawa does not ship with Swing help index files and
	Swing package files you need to download these files separately from the Kawa site. Please
	download the same from Kawa <a href="http://www.tek-tools.com/kawa/relate.htm">related</a> files 
	download area. Please follow the instructions on the site to install the Swing support files for
	Kawa.
	</li><br><br>
	<li>In order to be able to compile Swing programs under Kawa it is necessary to set appropriate classpaths
	under Kawa. Please refer to <a href="classpath.htm">How to set classpath</a> for more details on how to
	set the classpath to Swing swingall.jar file.
	</li>
	</ul>
	
<font color=brown><h2>JDK 1.2</h2></font>
	<ul>
	<li>Please download JDK 1.2 from <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/">JavaSoft</a> web site.
	</li><br><br>
	<li>Install JDK 1.2 and start Kawa. If Kawa warns you about JDK bin path not
	being set ignore the warning and go to Customize/Options dialog. Kawa should automatically take you
	to this dialog after the warning message. In case it does not, please select Customize/Options from 
	the menu to display the dialog.
	</li><br><br>	
	<li>Please set the Java bin directory under the JDK paths tab to point to JDK/bin directory. Click
	on the button ">>" to set this value. Kawa will automatically set the Java lib directory for you based
	on the bin path.
	</li><br><br>
	<li>Since JDK 1.2 source comes in a jar file you need to unjar this file for Kawa to be able to recognize
	or use the source file. Jar file can be opened using WinZip. Please unjar the file into src directory under
	JDK 1.2 folder and set the Java source path under Customize/Options/JDK Paths to point to this folder. If
	you decide not to unjar please set the Java source path to none.
	</li><br><br>	
	<li>Since the standard version of Kawa does not ship with JDK 1.2 help index files and
	JDK 1.2 package files you need to download these files separately from the Kawa site. Please
	download the same from Kawa <a href="http://www.tek-tools.com/kawa/relate.htm">related</a> files 
	download area. Please follow the instructions on the site to install the JDK 1.2 support files for
	Kawa.
