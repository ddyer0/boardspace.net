<P>JDB debugger is the other debugger under Kawa. This debugger is a simple wrapper on the jdb tool that is shipped
with JDK.</P>

<p>Please refer to <a href="debugger.htm">debugger</a> document for more details if Build/JDB debug menu command is
disabled.

<p>Select Build/JDB Debug to start the JDB debugger. Kawa will start the JDB debugger as a separate process and set
all the breakpoints that are defined in the project.

<p>You can send any custom properties to JDB debugger by setting the properties under project interpreter options or
global interpreter options.

<p>Please watch the Kawa output window for all JDB messages. This window also acts as input redirector for the JDB debugger.
Please type any JDB command at a breakpoint and Kawa will send the command as typed to the JDB debugger.

<p>The debugger behavior is identical to the other Kawa debugger. In that Kawa will try and open the source file for every
breakpoint that is hit. Break lines are indicated by a green arrow in the left margin.

<p>Please select Build/Debug/Step, Build/Debug/Step over or Build/Debug/Step up to step through the code. You can also use
the appropriate keyboard shortcuts.

<p>Double clicking on any variable name in the editor will signal Kawa to check the variable value. If required you can
type the command yourself in the Kawa output window to check any variable value.

<p>Please refer to JDK documentation on JDB for all the different JDB commands that ara available.

<p>Press F10 or Build/Debug/Exit to stop the debugger. It is always recommended to stop the running application or applet
to stop the debugger. Selecting F10 during JDB debug can leave orphan processes behind. Be sure to kill these processes
manually if you have to press F10 for any reason.
