<p>Kawa tries to open the JDK source file or non-JDK source file during debugging and double clicks in the output
window.
<p>Kawa first tries to locate the class name in the current project. If the class name is not found then it will
check the package tree for the same class. 
<p>If the class is found in the package tree Kawa will try to find the source file for the class under the Java
source path as set under Customize/Options/Directories/Java source path. If the source is not found in the Java
source path, Kawa will check the path value under Package source path for the same file and open the file if found.
<p>Package source path can be a semi-colon delimited list of paths and is set under Customize/Options/Directories/Kawa Paths.
<p>Please refer to <a href="kawasetup.htm">Kawa setup</a> and <a href="directorysetup.htm">Directory setup</a> for more details on setting various JDK and Kawa paths.
