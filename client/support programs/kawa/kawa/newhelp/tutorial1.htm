<h3><font color=brown>Compiling and running a Java app or applet Project</font></h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>
	We have chosen the DrawTest applet that is shipped with all versions of JDK for this tutorial. Please make sure
	you have installed all the demo programs when you install JDK. Locate the DrawTest demo program files. Under JDK 1.1 you 
	can find this under /demo/drawtest/1.1 and under JDK 1.2 you can find the same under /demo/applets/DrawTest.
	</li>
	<li>Please start Kawa and select Project/New menu option and change folder to DrawTest folder and create a project by name
	"DrawTest". This will create a new project DrawTest and open the project in Kawa.
	</li>
	<li>Next, we need to add some files to the project. Please right click on the project name DrawTest or select Project/Add File...
	menu option and pick the DrawTest.java file to add to the project. Kawa will add the file to the project tree.
	</li>
	<li>Please make sure your JDK paths are setup properly. Please refer to <a href="kawasetup.htm">Kawa Setup</a> for more details.</li>
	<li>Select Build/Rebuild All to compile all the files in the project. Please make sure there are no errors in
	the output window.</li>
	<li>In order to run this as an app we have to select the main class file or the file which has the class with main method defined. Right
	click your mouse on DrawTest.java file in the project tree and select Main Class from the ensuing menu. This will draw a red border
	aroud the file icon to indicate the main class file</li>
	<li>Select Build/Run menu option to run and you should see the DrawTest app run and the main window show up</li>
	<p>
	<li>We can also run this project as an applet because DrawTest is written to be run as an app or applet. In order to run an applet under
	Kawa we have to first add a HTML file to the project and select the HTML as main HTML file.</li>
	<li>Select Project/Add File... menu and  pick the example1.html to add to the project.</li>
	<li>Please right click your mouse on example1.html file in the project and select Main HTML menu option this time. Kawa will draw a blue
	border around the file icon to indicate main HTML file</li>
	<li>Select Build/Run menu option to now run DrawTest as an applet and you should see appletviewer running with the DrawTest applet</li>
<p>
</ul>
This finishes our first tutorial. We learnt how to create a new project, add files to project and build all the files in the project and run
the project.
