Kawa plugin is the new plugin architecture which lets you write Java programs to control Kawa. It is like
a Java API to extend Kawa functionality.

<p>Kawa plugin architecture is based on Java's JNI interface. As part of this architecture Kawa exposes 5 Java objects -
<a href="../plugin/docs/com.tektools.kawa.plugin.KawaApp.html">KawaApp</a>, 
<a href="../plugin/docs/com.tektools.kawa.plugin.KawaProject.html">KawaProject</a>, 
<a href="../plugin/docs/com.tektools.kawa.plugin.KawaEditor.html">KawaEditor</a>, 
<a href="../plugin/docs/com.tektools.kawa.plugin.KawaFile.html">KawaFile</a> and 
<a href="../plugin/docs/com.tektools.kawa.plugin.KawaFolder.html">KawaFolder</a>. 

<p>Some of the above objects defines event objects to indicate certain events. Please refer to
<a href="../plugin/docs/com.tektools.kawa.plugin.KawaAppEvent.html">KawaAppEvent</a>,
<a href="../plugin/docs/com.tektools.kawa.plugin.KawaProjectEvent.html">KawaProjectEvent</a> and
<a href="../plugin/docs/com.tektools.kawa.plugin.KawaFileEvent.html">KawaFileEvent</a>
for more details on Kawa plugin events.

<p>Each of these objects define certain methods to externally control and drive Kawa. This is a first
iteration of this architecture and we hope to grow this architecture more and more based on your feedback.

<p>The design goals for the first release of this architecture was better source control integration and
ability to setup custom builds for some large projects. We think we have achived both these goals with 
the first iteration.

<p>The only environment where Kawa plugin can run is when launched by Kawa. You can launch a plugin
command in 2 ways - setup a <a href="plugincommand.htm">custom plugin command</a> or use <a href="runplugin.htm">
single run plugin menu</a> option.

<p>Kawa plugins are enabled automatically. Please check Customize/Options/Editor to disable kawa plugins.

<p>All plugin classes are packed into kawaclasses.zip in Kawa folder and Kawa automatically sets the classpath
to this file. All plugin documentation files and plugin sample files are copied under /plugin folder in the
Kawa installation directory.

<p>We hope to come up with more sample plugin programs very soon. We also hope that you will get as much excited
as we are about this new architecture. Please provide as much feedback as you can on this new feature.

<p>Please click <a href="http://www.tek-tools.com/kawa/plugins.htm">here</a> to see the list of contributed plugins available for Kawa today. We will keep this list updated
frequently with new contributions. Also, please sens us an email if you have a plugin you want to contribute to
the Kawa user group.
