<p><b>With the introduction of the top level Kawa Projects folder
in the project tree it is not necessary to create a project for
single Java files or even simple projects. Previously, in order
to set custom compiler options or interpreter options it was
necessary to create a Kawa project. Since it is possible to set
these options globally at the Projects level, a project would
only need to be created to group files together, debugging, or to
create a dialog or frame resource via Kawa GUI builder. This is
done by selecting Project/New and typing a new name for the
project after selecting the appropriate directory. The new
project is automatically added to the projects tree and is made
the current open project.</b> </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Right click on the Project name in the project tree to
        add or delete files to the project. </b></li>
    <li><b>Right click on the Project name and select Compiler
        Options/Interpreter options to set various compiler
        options and interpreter options. These options are only
        for this project.</b> </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Kawa projects tree is capable of displaying multiple
projects in the tree. There are 2 ways to add Kawa project to the
projects tree - first method is to open the project from the menu
option Project/Open. If the project is not already in the tree
the project is added to the projects tree. Second method is to
select Add Project from the root Projects option right button
menu and selecting the project file to add to the tree. The
latter method does not open the project but it just adds the
project to the tree. </b></p>

<p><b>An existing project in the projects tree can be opened by
clicking right button on the project item and selecting Open from
the menu. However, there can be only one project open at any
given time. Open project is always the first item in the project
tree and is drawn with a bold font. </b></p>

<p><b>It is now possible to set global compiler, interpreter and
Javadoc options for all projects by right clicking on
&quot;Projects&quot; item in the tree. These options will apply
to all the projects in the tree and is superseded by project
options. Also, the global compiler and interpreter options apply
to individual Java files which are not part of any Kawa project.</b>
</p>

<p><b>In order to add or delete files or to set compiler or
interpreter options for a project the project has to be open. In
general to modify any project options the project will have to be
opened first. Compiling a file from the project tree by right
clicking on the file and selecting compile&#133; will apply all
the compiler options from the file's project even if the file is
not part of an open project.</b><b><i> </i></b></p>

<p><b>It is possible to add virtual folders to the project.
Selecting Add Folder from the Project right button menu will add
a folder to the project. Folder can be renamed any time by
selecting rename from the Folder right button menu. Files can be
added to a project folder by selecting Add File from the folder
right button menu or by simply dragging the files into the folder
from another project folder. Files can be dragged out of the
folders in the same way. Folders are just a convenient way of
arranging files by any criteria. Folders can be deleted just like
a file by selecting the folder and pressing the delete key or
selecting Delete from the folder right button menu.</b> </p>

<p><b>Please refer to </b><a href="projecttab.htm"><b>Projects
Tab </b></a><b>for more details on other Project tree options.</b>
