<p>This tab has undergone significant changes lately. Project
tab now displays all the projects that have been opened in Kawa
so far. </p>

<p>There are 3 methods to add projects to project tab. Select
Project/Open to open the project and the new project will be
added to the project tree and opened. The other method is to
select Project/New and create a new project. This project is
added to the project tab and opened. The last method is to right
click on root Projects item and select Add Project to add a
project to the project tree. </p>

<p>Opening a project is as simple as right clicking on the
project name and selecting Open. Open project is indicated by
bold font and is always at the top of the list. The remaining
projects are arranged alphabetically in the tree. There can be
only one project open at any given time. All the Project menu
options from the main menu are applied to the currently open
project.</p>

<p><a name="classview"><font size="5"></font></a><font
size="5">Class View -</font></p>

<p>Project tree can display either file view of the project or
the class view of the project. File view is always the default
view of the project. Class view will display all the packages in
the project and the classes under each package. In the figure
below the project AWTTest has a package called AWTTest.Test and
this package has all the classes and interfaces shown in the
figure. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="projecttab3.gif" width="399"
height="513"></p>

<p>Selecting Project/File View or Project/Class view will
toggle the view. Right clicking on the root Kawa Projects item
can also access this menu option. Selecting class view will
toggle the view for all the projects in the tree not just the
open project.</p>

<p>Following are the various tree items in the Project tree
and their context menus. </p>

<h2><a name="projectitem"></a>Project Item -</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="projecttab2.gif" width="289"
height="382"></p>

<p>Double clicking on a file name under a project will display
the file in the editor. </p>

<p>Expanding the file folder with the + button next to the
file name will parse the file automatically and display all the
classes and interfaces defined in the file. </p>

<p>Expanding the class item will display all the methods and
variables defined in that class. Double clicking on the class
name, method name or the variable name will open the file if
necessary and select the appropriate line where it is defined.
</p>

<p>Files can be rearranged in the project tree by dragging and
dropping the files in the appropriate position. This is helpful
when doing Rebuild All as the compilation order is determined by
the order in which files are displayed in the Project tree. </p>

<p>Project context menu or right button menu options are
self-explanatory. Add Folder options will add a new virtual
folder to the project. </p>

<p>Add Directory will add an entire directory structure to the
project. This command will scan the directory for all the java
files and add the entire directory to the selected folder maintaining the
directory hierarchy. Extremely useful command when importing
files from other editors.</p>

<p>Import Kawa project will import an existing Kawa project
along with all the virtual folders and files. </p>

<p>Close will close the project if it is open. </p>

<p>Update images will scan all the project files and update
the file and folder dirty indicator. Please refer to <a
href="dirtyfiles.htm">How to identify dirty files </a>for
more details. </p>

<p><a href="compileroptions.htm">Compiler</a>, <a
href="interpreteroptions.htm">Interpreter </a>and
Javadoc options will display the appropriate dialog box for
setting the various options for this project. </p>

<p>Any <a href="customcommands.htm">custom commands</a>
defined for a project menu item will be listed at the end of this
menu.</p>

<h2>Project Virtual Folder Item -</h2>

<p>Project virtual folder is a virtual folder as the name
implies. It allows grouping of project files into folders.
Folders can have folders and so on. The context menu for the
folder is the same as the Project Folder menu explained above
except any addition of files will be added to this virtual
folder. </p>

<p>Moving files into or out of the folder is a matter of
dragging file into or out of the folder. </p>

<p>Project virtual folder when closed has a check mark or a
cross mark to indicate if the folder has dirty files which needs
to be compiled. </p>

<p>Rebuild Folder will rebuild all the files in the selected folder.
