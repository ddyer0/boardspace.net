<p>Custom command parameters lets you create complex but
generic commands that can be used under all situations. It is
important to understand how this works. Command parameters are
accepted in Startup directory field and arguments field in the <a
href="customcommands.htm">Custom commands</a> dialog. </p>

<p>Custom command parameters can be typed in manually or it
can be picked from a listbox. The latter is preferable because it
is important to type the parameter accurately for it to work.
<p>
Custom command parameter is not case sensitive but the syntax is
sensitive. 
<p>
Using custom command parameters it is possible to
build complex paths and names. Anything outside of custom command
parameter is taken literally including the spaces and the quotes.
<p>
For example it is possible to have the argument field value
&quot;&lt;File Name&gt;.java &quot; which will append the current
file name in the editor with &quot;.java&quot; and make a full
file name. 
<p>
Some of the parameters refer to current file.
Current file is the file open in the editor if the command is
picked from the main menu. However, if the command is picked from
the project tree then current file is the selected file in the
project tree. 
<p>
This is an important distinction to keep in mind
when executing and defining the command. The same is true for
current project. Current project is the project open when the
menu is picked from the main menu or it is the project selected
in the project tree when the command is picked from the project
tree.
<p>
Following is a rundown of the various parameters defined under Kawa. 

<p>?Your Prompt Here? - Pops up a dialog box allowing a value
to be entered at the time the command is executed. The
appropriate title of the dialog box is the text placed between
the two question marks. This value can be used in the Startup
Directory, Arguments, and Output File Name boxes, and may be used
more than once on the arguments field.</p>

<p>&lt;Class of File&gt; - Parses the file and finds the first
class or interface and builds the class or interface name with
the package name. For example, if there is file with the package
Demo and class name RunDemo then &lt;Class of File&gt; will
return Demo.RunDemo. </p>

<p>&lt;ClassPath&gt; - Current classpath defined in Kawa. </p>

<p>&lt;File Directory&gt; - Directory of the current file. </p>

<p>&lt;File Ext&gt; - Extension of the current file with the
dot. </p>

extension but no path. </p>

<p>&lt;File Name&gt; - Just the file name </p>

<p>&lt;File Path&gt; - Full file name with path </p>
