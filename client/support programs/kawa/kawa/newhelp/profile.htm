<p><i>What is a profile ? </i></p>
<p>A Profile is a way of grouping and naming a set of paths as defined under Java Paths, Kawa paths and Advanced paths tabs
of the Customize/Options dialog shown below. Profile makes it easy to switch between different JDK versions. When you
compile, run or debug the JDK paths saved under the current profile is the one that is applied. If you are working with multiple versions of JDK then you should strongly consider setting up one profile for 
each version of JDK. 
<p>
Since Kawa stores the name of the profile as part of the project, opening a project will 
automatically change the profile to the one stored in the project.

<p><i>How to create a profile ?</i></p>

<p>In order to create a new profile, select Customize/Options from the menu and click the Edit Profiles button in
the Directories tab. The Configurations dialog allows the user to Add a new profile,
Delete or Rename an existing profile. Once a Profile has been selected in the Profile list
box, it becomes the current profile and all the currently selected paths for JDK, Kawa and Advanced
paths become part of the newly created profile.</p>

<p><em>How do I change profile path settings ?</em></p>

<p>Change any desired path under JDK Paths, Kawa paths or Advanced Paths and click on OK to save the changes to
the selected profile. Selecting cancel will not save the changes.

<p><em>How do I make a Profile as active profile ?</em></p>

<p>There are two ways of doing this. The user can either select a Profile in the
Customize/Options Directories tab and make it the current profile or select the desired
Profile in the Profile bar. Profile bar can be enabled by selecting View/Profile bar menu item and
can be dragged and placed in the desired location within the Kawa frame.</p>
