<h3><font color=brown>Debugging under Kawa</font></h3>
<p>
The steps for debugging under Kawa is the same for both JDK 1.1 and JDK 1.2. Kawa debugger is build on Java
debugger API and these classes are shipped as part of JDK. 
<p>
All the JDK classes are compiled without debug information and if you are interested in stepping into JDK
source code during debugging please refer to <a href="jdkdebugclassfile.html">Debug Class file</a> setup for
further instructions. 
<p>
Please refer to <a href="kawasetup.htm">Kawa Setup</a> for more information on how to
setting up source directory for JDK 1.2 so you can open the source files during debugging.
<p>
We will go back to DrawTest tutorial discussed under <a href="tutorial1.htm">tutorial 1</a> for learning how to debug. 
<ul>
	<li>Please select Project/Open menu option and select the DrawTest.kawa project file in the DrawTest
	folder to make it as the current project.
	</li>
	<li>Please select Project/Compiler options and check the Debugging tables(-g) option so we can regenerate class
	files with debug information
	</li>
	<li>Select Build/Rebuild All to rebuild the entire project.</li>
	<li>We need to set some breakpoints in the project so the debugger will stop execution when it hits the breakpoint.</li>
	<li>If the project is setup to run as an app please goto line 55 in DrawTest.java and press F9 to insert a breakpoint.
	If the project is setup to run as an applet please goto line 43 and set a breakpoint</li>
	<li>Select Build/Debug/Run or F5 to start the debugger. As soon as the breakpoint is hit, Kawa will automatically bring the
	focus to DrawTest.java file with a green arrow indicating the current line of execution.</li>
	<li>Also, Kawa will automatically change the project tab to debug tree which has a lot of debug information. The debug tree
	shows all the thread information and the current stack information. Please refer to <a href="debugger.htm">debugger</a> documentation
	for more details on some of these information.</li>
	<li>When the debugger is at a breakpoint, you can select Build/Debug/Step into or F8 to step into next instruction. Kawa will
	automatically open the source file if it is part of the JDK or part of the project. If the file is not part of the project and 
	not part of the JDK then please refer to <a href="debugger.htm">debugger</a> section 'Finding package source files' for more
	details on how to setup Kawa to open other source files</li>
	<li>Selecting Build/Debug/Step Over or F12 will step to the next line of execution in the current stack</li>
	<li>The debugger tree is automatically updated with new values as you step, step over or step up. Expanding an object in the
	debugger tree will automatically put a watch on this object</li>
	<li>You can set or clear breakpoints when the debugger is active. Selecting Continue or F5 again will continue the debugger
	until the next breakpoint is hit.</li>
	<li>Select Build/Debug/Exit or F10 to stop the debugger or exit the applet or application normally and the debugger will quit</li>
</ul>
