<p>Please install Kawa as a single user setup on the server first and
follow these steps on each client workstation that needs to access Kawa from the server.

<p>Please make a directory on the client workstation for all Kawa configuration files.

<p>Start Kawa on the client and goto Customize/Options/Directories and set the Kawa
configuration directory to the directory you just created on the client.

<p><b>Following are the files in the user directory - </b></p>

<ul>
<p>kawa.pkg - Package tab data file</p>

<p>user.ipg - User help index file</p>

<p>user.cmd - User custom commands file</p>

<p>kawa.hpg - Help tab file</p>

<p>kawa.proj - Kawa project file</p>

</ul>

If any of these files are not present on the server there is no need to copy the 
same on the client. Also, it is important to delete these files from the server
once copied to the client.

<p><b>Following files should go to Windows/System directory. </b>

<p><i>It is important to verify the version information of each DLL before
   copying it to System directory.</i></p>

<ul>
<p>mfc42.dll</p>

<p>msvcrt.dll</p>

<p>msvcrt40.dll</p>

<p>oleaut32.dll</p>

<p>olepro32.dll</p>

<p>stdole2.tlb</p>
</ul>

<p>All the remaining files can stay in the server directory. Also, when you create
a shortcut on the client to run Kawa, please make sure the current directory is the
directory on the server where Kawa files are residing. This is important.
