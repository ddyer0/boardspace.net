<p><em>What is a Project ?</em></p>

<p>In KAWA a Project is a logical collection of files. Various user options and
classpaths can be applied to a Project.</p>

<p><em>How do I create a new Project ?</em></p>

<p align="center"><img src="templa1.jpg" width="426" height="264"

<p>Under the Project menu, select New and enter the desired name of the Project in
the New project dialog. The newly created project will then be added to the Project tab.</p>

<p>
Please select Project/Add Files from the Project menu to add files to the project.

<p><em>How do I add an existing Project ?</em></p>

<p>Under Project menu, select Open to open the project and the new project will be
added to the project tree and opened. The open project is the active project. Also right
click on root Projects item and select Add Project to add a project to the project tree.
This would however not make the added project the active project and hence not open the
project.</p>

<p><em>How do I Open and Delete a Project in the Project tree ?</em></p>

<p>Opening a project is as simple as right clicking on the project name and
selecting Open. Open project is indicated by bold font and is always at the top of the
list. The remaining projects are arranged alphabetically in the tree. There can be only
one project open at any given time. All the Project menu options from the main menu are
applied to the currently open project. Also selecting Open from the Project menu will add
and open the project. In order to delete a project, right click a project and select
Delete. <u>Please note</u> that an open Project cannot be deleted.</p>
