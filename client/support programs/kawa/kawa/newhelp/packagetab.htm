<p>Kawa package tab is a very important piece of Kawa. It is
important to understand how packages work under Kawa in order to
use Kawa efficiently. When Kawa is first installed it comes with
all the packages that are defined in JDK 1.1.x packages. All the
package information is stored in a file called kawa.pkg, which
can be located in the Kawa files directory. It is possible to
open a Kawa package file anytime after Kawa has started by
selecting File/Open and selecting the .pkg file to open. This
will populate the package tab with all the packages information
from the opened file. </p>

<p>Kawa uses the information from the package tree to provide
the all important override feature. In order to be able to
override from non-JDK packages it is important to first add the
package to the Package tab by selecting one of the Add/Update
options from the right button menu of the root item in the tree.
JDK package information can be updated when Javasoft comes out
with new releases by just selecting Add/Update and selecting the
appropriate java files or class files or jar or zip file to
update the package information. </p>

<p>The only method to add classes to the package tree is via java source
files. Please select package/Add Java... menu option and pick one or more
Java files and Kawa will add the classes from these file to the package tree
under the apprpriate package name.

<p>As shown above the package tab </p>

<ul>
    <li>Displays all the packages defined under Kawa. Kawa
        comes predefined with all the JDK 1.1.x packages. </li>
    <li>Each package folder in turn lists all the classes and
        interfaces defined under it. </li>
    <li>Each class in turn has all the methods and variables
        defined in it. </li>
    <li>This information is used for the override feature of
        Kawa. It is important to have a class defined under this
        tab for the override menu to show the class. </li>
    <li>If the Java source file directory and the package
        source directory is set properly under
        Customize/Options/Directory, then double clicking on
        class name, method name etc. will bring up the
        appropriate java source file. Kawa first searches the JDK
        source directory for the file and if the file is not
        found it walks through the package source path to find
        the file. If the source file is found then Kawa will open
        the file in the editor with the line under question
        highlighted. </li>
    <li>Pressing F2 in the editor on a word will open up the
        appropriate class or interface if found in the package
        hierarchy </li>
    <li>All the package information is stored in the file
        Kawa.pkg. It is important to have this file in the Kawa
        files directory and Kawa files directory path should be
        indicated under Customize/Options/Directory for this file
        to be found </li>
    <li>Click right button and select Find class or Find
        interface to find a class or interface in the hierarchy.
    </li>
    <li>Any package or class can be deleted by selecting the
        item and pressing the DEL key.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Class Context Menu -</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="packagetab2.gif"></p>

<ul>
    <li>Help will display help on the selected item </li>
    <li>In the above figure, the menu is a context menu for
        Applet class. All of the base classes for the Applet are
        listed in the menu. Selecting any one of the base classes
        will select that class in the hierarchy. This helps
        moving from one class to any of its base classes very
        quickly. </li>
    <li>Please read the notes above on all the add options. </li>
    <li>Find class and Find Interface is for locating a class
        or an interface in the hierarchy. </li>
    <li>Find Next will find the previously searched item
        again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Package tree now displays all the inner class information
and exception thrown information as shown in the top most figure
above. Since Kawa upgrade setup does not upgrade the package file
it is necessary to update all the Java package files to display
the inner class and exception information. Also, because of the
new information displayed in the project tree the memory
requirement for the package tree has increased. Therefore, it is
important to keep the package tree very concise as possible.</p>
