     *****		 Simultaneous moves support *****
     * 
     * Games where all the players move at the same time cause a lot of problems, but
     * it's the right thing to do in some cases.  The current games that use at least
     * some simultaneous moves are:
     *  Euphoria, Magnet, Raj, One Day In London, Q.E., Breaking Away, Tammany Hall, and Imagine
     * 
     * The root of the problem is that players WILL disagree about the order of arrival of 
     * asynchronous moves. This causes their game records to be different from one another,
     * and causes the server's incremental bookkeeping of the game state to be seen as
     * inconsistent.
     * 
     * The overall strategy for dealing with his problem is to segregate the simultaneous
     * moves to the end of the game record, and anchor the server's record of the game at
     * the beginning of the ephemeral block.   At appropriate points, the ephemeral moves
     * are replaced in the game record by equivalent non-ephemeral moves in canonical order.
     * 
     * 
     * Another problem is time accounting - while in simultaneous mode, the clocks for all 
     * the players who have not completed their move should tick.
     * 
     * Tendrils to support this are all over the place, which made support difficult; but
     * the most common solutions are embodied in requirements for move specs, states, and
     * in overridable methods of commonCanvas 
     * 
     * the xxMovespec class will use pairs of ephemeral/normal moves, and implement
     * and board states which allow asynchronous moves will be distinct from the states
     * that do not.
     *  
     * Reviews of games which originally had simultaneous moves will have all synchronous
     * moves, so the game engine ought to function perfectly with any ephemeral moves.
