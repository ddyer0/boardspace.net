/**
 * The Robot player only has to implement the basic methods to generate and evaluate moves.
 * the actual search is handled by the search driver framework.
 * 
 * In general, the Robot has it's own thread and operates on a copy of the board, so the
 * main UI can continue unaffected by the processing of the robot.
 * 
 * This robot player will play a random game of Mutton.
 * As the wolf:
 *    When eating, a random sheep that is a valid meal will be picked.  If there are no sheep
 *    that are valid meals, then a random wolf that is a valid meal will be eaten.
 * As the farmer:
 *    A random suspect from the most recent eaten victim will be shot.
 *    The robot will *never* go on a rampage.
 *    If shotgun is enabled, then all of the scared sheep will be moved to random empty
 *    cells on the board.
 * 
 * Yes, this is a particularly stupid farmer player... :)
 * 
 * Note:
 *    This mutton robot picks a random valid move each time.  It does not use
 *    any of the typical min/max type of board evaluation.
 *    So, this robot really wants to just implement the SimpleRobotProtocol.
 *    However, the sample code provided (Hex) uses the full min/max search engine
 *    and only exposes those interfaces used by that engine and (presumably) hides 
 *    other important work that would need to be done for a SimpleRobotProtocol
 *    (run(), for example...).
 * 
 *    So, this code pretends to do min/max, but doesn't really.
 *    It implements DoFullMove() to return a move, but the rest of the min/max
 *    functions are stubbed out and never called.
