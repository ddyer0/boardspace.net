/**
 * The Robot player only has to implement the basic methods to generate and evaluate moves.
 * the actual search is handled by the search driver framework.
 * 
 * In general, the Robot has it's own thread and operates on a copy of the board, so the
 * main UI can continue unaffected by the processing of the robot.
 * 
 * This robot player is version 2, and plays a better game of Mutton than the random bot.
 * 
 * For the standard Mutton game, there are 14,950 ways that the wolves can be chosen.
 *   26 animals taken 4 at a time = (26!) / ((4!) * (26-4)!) = 14,950.
 * The core functionality of this robot player is that all 14,950 combinations are
 * evaluated against the current history of eaten events.  If a combination is not
 * consistent with history, then it is thrown out.  The valid configs are then totaled
 * up to determine the number of times that each living animal appears in the valid
 * configs.  The higher this number, then the more likely that animal is of being a
 * wolf.
 * 
 * As the wolf:
 *    When eating:
 *       We pretend to eat each potential meal and evaluate what the farmer would know
 *       if that new meal were added to the history.  We then choose the meal that
 *       keeps the average probability of all animals being a wolf to a minimum.
 *
 *    When moving:
 *       We look at the result of moving all suspects into all valid empty spaces
 *       and then look at all of the meals that we would have (assuming the farmer
 *       doesn't shoot anyone) and evaluate what the farmer would know if that new
 *       meal were added to the history.  Of all of these moves, we pick the move
 *       that keeps the average probability of all animals being a wolf to a minimum.
 *       Note: Actually trying all suspects into all empty spaces takes a very long
 *             time, computationally.  (For 6 suspects, it took over 4 minutes to
 *             move on a 2.5Ghz PC).  To avoid this, the number of simultaneous
 *             movers is limited to 3.  If there are more than 3 suspects to be
 *             moved, then 3 are picked at random and used to evaluate the positions.
 *             Since only 1 animal is moved at a time, the robot player will be
 *             called again to move the remaining ones.  Until the number of suspects
 *             to be moved drops below 3, then we're really making a local best-effort
 *             move rather than a global best-effort move.
 * 
 * As the farmer:
 *    When shooting:
 *       We evaluate the probability of all animals being a wolf.  If the animal
 *       with the highest probability is above a threshold, then we will shoot it.
 *       (If there are more than 1 animal with the same highest probability, then
 *       we pick one of them randomly.)  The shooting threshold starts at 60% and
 *       is reduced by 5% for every dead sheep.
 *       If we have determined exactly who the wolves are (ie: all living wolves
 *       have a probability of 100%), then we will rampage and shoot all of them
 *       on our turn.
 *
 *    When moving:
 *       We look at the result of moving all scared sheep into all vacant spaces
 *       and look at all the meals that the wolf might do on his next turn.  For
 *       each possible next meal, we determine how many wolf configs would remain
 *       and we pick the move that makes the remaining configs the smallest.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 *    This mutton robot does some look-ahead, but does not use any of the typical
 *    min/max type of board evaluation.
 *    So, this robot really wants to just implement the SimpleRobotProtocol.
 *    However, the sample code provided (Hex) uses the full min/max search engine
 *    and only exposes those interfaces used by that engine and (presumably) hides 
 *    other important work that would need to be done for a SimpleRobotProtocol
 *    (run(), for example...).
 * 
 *    So, this code pretends to do min/max, but doesn't really.
 *    It implements DoFullMove() to return a move, but the rest of the min/max
 *    functions are stubbed out and never called.
