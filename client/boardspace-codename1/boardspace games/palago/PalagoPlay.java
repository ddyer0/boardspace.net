/** 
 * Palago uses alpha-beta only
 * 
 * the Robot player only has to implement the basic methods to generate and evaluate moves.
 * the actual search is handled by the search driver framework.
 * 
 * in general, the Robot has it's own thread and operates on a copy of the board, so the
 * main UI can continue unaffected by the processing of the robot.
 * 
 * some thoughts about the hierarchy of moves governing "next move" tactics.
 * an "opportunity" is a pattern that can construct a double threat.
 * an opponent's opponent's opportunity is a "blot"
 * 
 * 1) win directly (opportunity to win exists)
 * 2) defend against a direct threat (direct thread exists)
 * 3) convert an opportunity into a double threat (attack and win)
 * 4a) if multiple blots exist, make a direct attack
 * 4b) if a single blot exists, eliminate it or make a direct attack.
 * 4c) if no blots exist, construct a new opportunity or make a direct attack.
 * 4d) make some other strategically useful move.
