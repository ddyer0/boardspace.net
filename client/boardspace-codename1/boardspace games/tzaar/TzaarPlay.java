/** 
 * Tzaar uses alpha-beta
 * 
 * the Robot player only has to implement the basic methods to generate and evaluate moves.
 * the actual search is handled by the search driver framework.
 * 
 * in general, the Robot has it's own thread and operates on a copy of the board, so the
 * main UI can continue unaffected by the processing of the robot.
 * 
 * UCT notes; there's no obvious source of weakness, but the UCT bot likes to capture
 * more than stack, and loses out when its (short) stack is captured.  I think this is
 * a case where if the alpha-beta search can see deeply enough to find a unique winning
 * line, that line may not be even visible to the uct bot.
