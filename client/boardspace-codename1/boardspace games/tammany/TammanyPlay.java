/** 
 Tammany Hall uses Mcts
 
 To begin with, the obvious problem with Tammany Hall is the complexity and difficulty of deciding how
 much influence to deploy in elections.  With a little more thought, another huge problem is that each
 player gets 4 complete moves before the elections provide any score changes.   This makes standard 
 alpha-beta so difficult, I'm not even considering it as a viable robot strategy.
 
 Phase 0: eliminate obviously bad votes,
   voting tokens in elections with no chance at all to win.
   voting more tokens than are necessary to guarantee a win.
   avoid generating situationally duplicate moves, as when there are two green cubes available in Castle Gardens.
   avoid placing cubes in wards with no bosses
   avoid locking wards with no bosses
   only slander in the last year before an election
    
   These are done for all robot moves, even in the "None" evaluator.
   
 Phase 1: "Progressive" change from win/loss scoring to proportional scoring.  The intent of this is to encourage the
  bot to always chase the leader, instead of "giving up" as seems to be the case if it is far enough
  behind.

 Phase 2: Add preliminary minimal evaluation weights to balance the dilution caused by similar moves.
  In particular, weight castle garden moves more when there are multiple colors of cube available.  Also
  weight slander and lock moves to occur in the last moves of a term.  These result in an immediate improvement.
  This corresponds to the "baseline" evaluator
 
 Phase 3: "Preferred" add more specific weighting,
  to favor playing bosses in boss-less wards, 
  to favor playing bosses in wards with lots of cubes (available to win control of).
  to discourage playing many bosses in the same ward
  
 Phase 4: "Contender" even more specific weighting, to add bosses only where you can be a 
  contender, and cubes only where you don't have to fight for them.
  
 Phase 5: "Basher" give the leader diminished credit for votes available, in the "Contender"
   calculations.  This encourages attacks on the leader.  
   
 Phase 6: "Basher" improvements, slander only on the last move, and adjust boss placement emphasis
   so that placing and then immediately slandering is a likely possibility.  Punish slander that
   doesn't help our boss, as well as boosting slander that does.  This leaves "no slander" as the
   neutral position in the weights.
   
 Phase 7: "LessBasher" reduce the overall weight of the move biases.
 
 Phase 8: "Voter" reduce weight on "0" votes.  Add weights to nonzero votes to equalize consideration for votes whose tally
 	is obtainable many different ways.
 	
 Phase 9: "EducatedVoter" pre-weight boss placement in the slander round for wards where a slander may be useful.
  	weight slander placement where it actually takes over a ward, and where the slanderee can't retaliate.

/*
 * This is a set of notes charting the development of a MCTS AI for Tammany Hall. The MCTS framework I use provides a few hooks to plug in the specifics for a particular game. The most important hooks are to generate a list of candidate moves, to generate a random candidate move, and to execute a chosen move. At the point this blog starts, the game engine is complete, able to generate and execute moves, and needs an AI.


Tammany Hall is an area control game for 3-5 players, where players alternate between placing "bosses", collecting "influence" tokens, and conducting "elections" where the combination of bosses and influences feed into the score. Every move involves explicit interaction with the other players choices.

The miracle or MCTS is that sometimes a move generator is all that's needed to play a somewhat plausible game. Not in this case.

Phase 0: eliminate obviously bad moves. Some moves which are legal are so obviously bad that they can be eliminated from consideration. For example, expending votes in an election where you have no chance to win, or expending more influence (votes) than are needed to guarantee a win. Also in this category are generating moves that are functionally duplicates. AIs with this improvement always defeat those with only the baseline implementation, if only because they effectively get more playouts in a fixed allocation of time.

Phase 1: Change from win/loss scoring to proportional scoring. The intent of this is to encourage the bot to always improve its score, even when it is far enough behind that it never wins. This makes the UCT feedback more sensitive to the actual outcome. This is particularly appropriate for games such as Tammany where the winning condition is a score rather than a situation such as checkmate. Tammany AIs with this improvement always win over win/loss bots.

Phase 2: Add preliminary minimal evaluation weights to balance the dilution caused by similar moves. The basic concept is to seed "tree" moves with fake results from some number of imaginary playouts, and to seed "random" moves so that the probability of a move is proportional to its likelyhood in actual play. This is where simple heuristics such as "occupy empty wards" can be implemented. AIs with this method, and any plausible set of weights, defeat AIs without them.

-- at this point in development, we leave the zone where each change is a miracle that immediately superceeds the previous version. The general mode I use is to play robot-vs-robot games, where all robots play using the same algorithm. Note the stupidist thing the losing bot does, imagine a new factor or change of weights that would change the stupid thing. One has to run multiple randomized trials to validate incremental improvements in the algorithm. Many supposed improvements don't generalize, or have unanticipated consequences.

Phase 3: Add more specific weighting. Favor placing bosses in wards that influence more ethnic cubes. Discourage playing multiple bosses in the same ward.

Phase 4: Consider if additional boss/cube placement swings the weight of influence in a ward in your favor, essentually "if the election happened now, could we win".

Phase 5: Give the player in the lead less credit for his voting position, to encourage attacking him even if not strictly well founded.

Phase 6: Adjust influence placement emphasis so that placing an outvoted boss, and then "slander" to immediately eliminate the opponent is more likely. Give bonuses for using this tactic against the players when they cannot retaliate due to turn order. Add weights to discourage slander that doesn't directly benefit us.

Phase 7: Reduce the overall weight of the move biases, now that they are much more specific. This was based on the observation that UCT moves were not moving far from their a-priori positions as determined by the weights.

Phase 8: Add move weighting for votes. The basic algorithm for generating "vote" moves is to generate all possible legal votes that otherwise pass the filter for pointless votes. This suffers from the same "dilution" effect that cube placement moves do; There might be a dozen ways to generate a vote of 4 chips, so without adjustment, a vote of 7 will be under-considered compared to a vote of 1.

At this point in the development, many new ideas do not pan out, and the process or trying them out is very time consuming. My standard method for this game is to play a 4 player game all the way to the end, with 2 robots playing the "improved" algorithm and 2 robots playing the current standard algorithm.
Score +2 if the two experimental AIs finish first and second.
+1 if they finish first and third,
- 1 if they finish second and fourth
-2 if they finish third and fourth
0 otherwise.
At about 40 minutes per game, it takes a long time to validate a genuine improvement, and shortcuts (running only a few games) risk approving a non-improvement, or rejecting a genuine improvement. For example, using this methodology to compare the current "best" algorithm to one
a few steps back on the improvement chart, achieved a score of +7 out of a possible +34 on 17 games.

It appears that the scope for further improvements by tinkering with move weighting (to encourage or discourage certain types of moves) is pretty small.
