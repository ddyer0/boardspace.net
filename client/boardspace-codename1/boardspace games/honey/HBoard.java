     * of time which have the same moves.

     * that have returned the game to a previous state; ie when you undo a move or
     * hit the reset button.  
     * (2) Digest is used after EditHistory to verify that replaying the history results
     * in the same game as the user is looking at.  This catches errors in implementing
     * undo, reset, and EditHistory
	 * (3) Digest is used by standard robot search to verify that move/unmove 
	 * returns to the same board state, also that move/move/unmove/unmove etc.
	 * (4) Digests are also used as the game is played to look for draw by repetition.  The state
     * after most moves is recorded in a hashtable, and duplicates/triplicates are noted.
     * (5) games where repetition is forbidden (like xiangqi/arimaa) can also use this
     * information to detect forbidden loops.
	 * (6) Digest is used in fraud detection to see if the same game is being played
     * over and over. Each game in the database contains a digest of the final
     * state of the game, and a midpoint state of the game. Other site machinery
     * looks for duplicate digests.  
     * (7) digests are also used in live play to detect "parroting" by running two games
     * simultaneously and playing one against the other.
