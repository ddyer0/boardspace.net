/** 
 * Notes about this bot.
 * 
 * This is strictly a "blitz monte carlo" robot.  Implementing "unmove" required
 * by other strategies is onerous.  
 * 
 * The "random" play out used by monte carlo is not really random.  Moves that are thought
 * to be desirable get higher weights, and moves that are thought to be bad get lower weights.
 * Without these biases, the robot tended to pile up enormous stacks of goods without using them,
 * and was strangely reluctant to open markets.
 * 
 * This uses a simple hill-climbing evaluator based on the number of authority tokens
 * that have been awarded, but with few additional tweaks.  A more elaborate version
 * intended to encourage correct play did not help.
 * 
 * the robot move generator will not generate some moves that I consider categorically bad,
 * such as using 3 cards when a pair is available.  There are no doubt marginal circumstances
 * where this is not correct, helps a lot in the battle to keep the robot from making silly moves.
 * 
 * As with other games with chance and hidden information, care needs to be taken
 * that no hidden information leaks from the "real" board to the robot board, particularly
 * the next cards to turn up or the next dice to roll.  To do this, the hidden components
 * are randomized at the top of each descent through the game tree.  This can cause problems
 * in the stored part of the tree, if the re-randomization changes the set of legal moves
 * in a way that affects other moves in the stored part of the tree.
