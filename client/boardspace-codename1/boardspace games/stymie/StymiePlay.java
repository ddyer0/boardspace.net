/** 
 * Stymie uses alpha-beta only
 * 
 * the Robot player only has to implement the basic methods to generate and evaluate moves.
 * the actual search is handled by the search driver framework.
 * <p>
 * in general, the Robot has it's own thread and operates on a copy of the board, so the
 * main UI can continue unaffected by the processing of the robot.
 * <p>
 * Notwithstanding the "only" above, debugging robot players can be very
 * difficult, both at the elementary level when the robot crashes out or
 * produces obviously wrong results, or at the advanced level when the robot
 * produces an undesirable result that is not blatantly wrong.
 * <p>
 * debugging aids:
 * <p>
 * <li>{@link #List_Of_Legal_Moves} should produce only legal moves, and should
 * by default produce all legal moves, but if your board class has some consistency
 * checking, errors constructing the move list might be detected. 
 * 
 * <li>Turn on the "start evaluator" action, and experiment with board positions
 * in puzzle mode.  Each new position will print the current evaluation.
 * 
 * <li>when the robot is stopped at a breakpoint (for example in {@link #Static_Evaluate_Position}
 * turn on the "show alternate board" option to visualize the board position.  It's usually
 * not a good idea to leave the option on when the robot is running because there will be
 * two threads using the data simultaneously, which is not expected.
 *
 * <li>turn on the save_digest and check_duplicate_digest flags.
 *
 ** <li>set {@link #verbose} to 1 or 2.  These produce relatively small amounts
 * of output that can be helpful understanding the progress of the search
 *
 ** <li>set a breakpoint at the exit of {@link #DoFullMove} and example the
 * top_level_moves variable of the search driver.  It contains a lot of information
 * about the search variations that were actually examined.
 *
 * <li>for a small search (shallow depth, few nodes) turn on {@link #SAVE_TREE}
 * and set a breakpoint at the exit of {@link #DoFullMove}
