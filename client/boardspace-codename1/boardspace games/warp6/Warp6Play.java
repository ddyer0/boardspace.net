/** 
 * Warp6 uses alpha-beta
 * 
 * the Robot player only has to implement the basic methods to generate and evaluate moves.
 * the actual search is handled by the search driver framework.
 * 
 * in general, the Robot has it's own thread and operates on a copy of the board, so the
 * main UI can continue unaffected by the processing of the robot.
 * 
 * A special feature of Knockabout is that the dice rolls add an element of chance
 * to the outcome.  This very simple robot completely ignores the issue, it just
 * rolls and assumes that whatever it rolled is what it will get.  It seems to
 * give pretty good results anyway.  The plan if it becomes necessary to do better
 * is to do rollouts.
 * 
 * Some care has to be taken to make sure the "fixed" randomness in the robot
 * doesn't leak out to the real game, for example, the robot generates a move
 * based on an expected roll, but it shouldn't actually get that roll.
