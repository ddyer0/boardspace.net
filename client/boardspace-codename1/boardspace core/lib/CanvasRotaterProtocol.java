/**
 * the general scheme for rotating individual windows is to keep the physical window
 * unchanged, but arrange for the contents to be drawn in a rotated way, and the mouse
 * coordinates to be similarly transformed.   
 * 
 * For rotation 2, which is upside-down, x and y are moved diagonally across the screen.
 * For rotation 1 and 3, the width and height are swapped and x or y reversed.  
 * 
 * The drawing and mouse handling code is all oriented to the  rotated screen size, so they
 * have to be careful to ignore the physical size.   the setLocalBounds() layout receives
 * the rotated width and height.
