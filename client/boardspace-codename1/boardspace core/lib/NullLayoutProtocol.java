 * standard java layouts are pretty much a disaster IMO, so consequently 
 * boardspace doesn't use them for much of anything.  Instead, windows
 * typically implement NullLayoutProtocol and use new NullLayout(this)
 * as their layout manager.
 * 
 * Boardspace also typically uses a single "canvas" window for each major frame,
 * and the canvas lays itself up using a setLocalBounds.
 * Frames that contain a single window typically make that subwindow full sized.
 * Frames that contain multiple real windows not typically used.
