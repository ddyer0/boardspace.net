/**
 * one of the rules for a well behaved application is that the actions resulting
 * from buttons and menus should be handled by the main process thread rather than
 * the AWT thread.  The best way for this to be adhered to is if the canvases don't
 * receive the events in the first place.   This class implements a listener which
 * maintains a queue of events for the listeners to consume.
 * <p>
 * this class is appropriate to be made an ActionLIstener or ItemListener, it will
 * automatically accept events on behalf of the canvas, and then develiver them to
 * the game event loop on request.
