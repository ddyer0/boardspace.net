/**
 * The listener interface for receiving mouse motion events on a component.
 * (For clicks and other mouse events, use the <code>MouseListener</code>.)
 * <P>
 * The class that is interested in processing a mouse motion event
 * either implements this interface (and all the methods it
 * contains) or extends the abstract <code>MouseMotionAdapter</code> class
 * (overriding only the methods of interest).
 * <P>
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * component using the component's <code>addMouseMotionListener</code>
 * method. A mouse motion event is generated when the mouse is moved
 * or dragged. (Many such events will be generated). When a mouse motion event
 * occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and
 * the <code>MouseEvent</code> is passed to it.
