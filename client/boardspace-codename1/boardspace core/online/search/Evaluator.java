/**
 * HiveGameBoard knows all about the game of Hive, which is played
 * on a hexagonal board. It gets a lot of logistic support from 
 * common.hexBoard, which knows about the coordinate system.  
 * 
 * This class doesn't do any graphics or know about anything graphical, 
 * but it does know about states of the game that should be reflected 
 * in the graphics.
 * 
 *  The principle interface with the game viewer is the "Execute" method
 *  which processes moves.  Note that this
 *  
 *  In general, the state of the game is represented by the contents of the board,
 *  whose turn it is, and an explicit state variable.  All the transitions specified
 *  by moves are mediated by the state.  In general, my philosophy is to be extremely
 *  restrictive about what to allow in each state, and have a lot of tripwires to
 *  catch unexpected transitions.   We expect to be fed only legal moves, but mistakes
 *  will be made and it's good to have the maximum opportunity to catch the unexpected.
 *  
 * Note that none of this class shows through to the game controller.  It's purely
 * a private entity used by the viewer and the robot.
