/* support for hex boards which start as a rhombus of some size, then can be
 * dynamically enlarged one cell at a time.  This is intended to be used for
 * boardless hex games such as Palago and Hive 
 *
 * as a side effect of dynamically enlarging the board, the "col" field of cells
 * can wander out of the normal A-Z range, which would wreak havoc in game records,
 * so the *printed* representation of col will be 3A 2A 1A A B ... Z 1Z 2Z 3Z
 * this requires some minor adjustment in the xxMovespec class for each game.
 * also, because it's encoded as a char, the range is not really infinite, but
 * 0-255 (or maybe more) will have to do.
 * 
 * another side effect of adding cells after the fact is that the printing order 
 * based on the raster is pretty much toast.  Instead, we make a sorted version
 * of the cell array, sorted appropriately for the Itype.xxx iterator request.
 * This is cached, so care has to be taken to uncache it when the cell list 
 * changes, or the perspective/screen reverse causes the presentation to change.
 * 
 * The torus option is still available, and can be used for legacy games made with
 * torroid boards.  Flipping back and forth from torus to expandable is possible,
 * but some care has to be taken.
 * 
 * Adding new cells is not completely automatic, GetCell will create new cells
 * automatically, and you can call createAdjacentCells to expand the margins.
