/** Technically speaking, an add-on game for boardspace only needs
 * to implement ViewerProtocol.  Everything else is optional.  
 * <p>
 * Generally speaking, the game window will create some class that implements this protocol
 * and call doInit.  The game controller will collect the players and spectators and maintain
 * communications with the server and among the players.  There are just a few "incoming"
 * type events that the client class will need to handle, and only a few "outgoing" pieces of
 * information that the client will need to provide.
 * <p>
 * Generally speaking, the client class will generate a series of simple messages that describe
 * the events in the game.  All the clients in the game (both spectators and players)
 * work from this stream and maintain their state from it.
 * <p>
 * Disconnections, reconnection, new spectators, and resumptions of suspended games
 * are handled by requiring the clients to produce a "replay" string, and to be
 * able to parse and interpret similar strings.  Generally, these strings are in a format
 * very similar to the routine messages in the game, so essentially new clients are synchronized 
 * by feeding them the game history.
 * <p>
 * Another important point is that error logging is automatic, so information about problems 
 * with the client will be available in the debugging environment and on the server.
