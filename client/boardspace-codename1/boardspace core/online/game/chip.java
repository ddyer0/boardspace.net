/**
 * this is the base class for "chips" which are objects typically
 * placed on boards.  It also can be used for random other graphics
 * associated with a game, including the board itself.  
 * Chips inherit from {@link DrawableImage} which supplies the graphic functionality.
 * <p>
 * chips are typically immutable objects that can be shared among boards without copying.
 * and they are also uniquely identified and digestable.  Chips come in 
 * sets (of all the types of objects used in a game) and each chip type
 * should be unique.  Chips are typically loaded once and stored in
 * a static variable, so all chips in use will be the same object in
 * all games, and in all boards (robots use a separate board that's a
 * copy of the actual game)
 * <p>
 * each game typically subclasses chip with it's particular artwork and
 * characteristics.  Bits of artwork that are not game pieces can be loaded
 * as chips too so they can be handled uniformly.
