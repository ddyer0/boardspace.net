Boardspace is a soup-to-nuts system for real time board games, to be played online 
using a L.A.M.P. architecture web site, or offline as a standalone game engine.

The main code for the game engine is Java based.

Supported platforms include Windows, Macintosh and Linux - basically any platform
that supports JRE - and also IOS and Android devices using the Codename1 code base
to generate native mobile apps from Java sources.

The game engine includes game-agnostic frameworks for Alpha-Beta and Mcts search
engines, and actual playing programs for most games.

There are implementations for more than 100 games, mostly abstract strategy games, 
but a smattering of word games, and euro style multiplayer games.
