Steps to configure a server.  

Suppose you have a virgin L.A.M.P server with only the stock starting software installed.
These are things you need to do to make it boardspace.

SSH:

Disable ssh logins from root.  When doing root things, you will have to login to a 
user account first, then su to root. 

Change the ssh port.  There are random bots trolling the standard port, tying passwords, all
the fucking time. Boardspace uses port 9130 for ssh

MYSQL:

Disable mysql login from remote hosts.  Instead, to do mysql things remotely, use
the path that uses ssh to a user account, tunneled to mysql.  Mysqladmin supports this.

Create and install the databases.  The "boardspace" database us all that's reqired, 
but the phpbb database is also used.  The verion of phpbb used on boardspace is ancient,
but has been specially modified to share boardspace' login information.  If the php database
is not installed, some of the boardspace registration and account editing scripts will malfunction.

Database names and passwords need to be installed in cgi-bin/include.pl and include.csh

Manual database tweaks (inspection, changes...) are much easier to make using MysqlWorkbench
from a pc.  Congfigure it to use ssh tunneling.  Use with extreme caution!
