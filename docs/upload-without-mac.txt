[update 10/1/2023] Apple broke itmstransporter sometime around the beginning of 2023,
and hasn't fixed it yet, so as of now, this doesn't work.

There's an incantation to allow uploading apps to the apple store without using a mac

https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/3597

This is embodied in the "upload.cmd" script

general process;  

install the "iTMSTransporterToolInstaller_2.3.0.36.exe" tool
create a per-app password on the apple portal, edit all the
fixed paths and names into the upload.cmd script

to actually do an upload, move the .ipa and appstoreinfo.plist into the usual place,
open a shell and run the upload command


Sample upload.cmd 

# this script uploaded a .ipa file to the apple store from a pc
# so you don't really need a real mac and "transporter" after all.
# download the .ipa and the AppStoreInfo.plist files from the build server,
# then run this script.
echo "uploading %1"
