how to release a new version

for the desktop clients:

open Kawa, compile "boardspace-core" and then "boardspace-games"
open a shell, run "jdk11c"
open winscp, copy "v102" to boardspace
rename v102 to the next version
edit the "jws" link to refer to the new version
edit include.pl to refer to the new version

various shortcuts are possible, but not always reliable.  In particular,
if only one game is modified, you can upload and directly replace that
game jar.


for ios and android

edit the "codenameone settings" be sure the version numbers have been increased
build andoid/ios development builds in boardspace-cn2 
build android/ios release builds in boardspace-cn1 project
download/test the dev builds directly on devices
download all 4 builds, rename, save in codename1/releases directory

for android, upload to google play and amazon app store
https://play.google.com/console/
https://developer.amazon.com/
for ios, upload to itunes
https://itunesconnect.apple.com/login/
