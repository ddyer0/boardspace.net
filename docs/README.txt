Historical interest only!  

virginsource.zip is the source of it all - the early but working tantrix.com web site
developed by internativity.  Note the date on the contained files - 1996!
These sources were used as a basis for all subsequent development of tantrix.com,
and later were forked to be the basis for boardspace.net.  A long trip!
