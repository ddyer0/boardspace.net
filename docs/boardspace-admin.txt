11/2006 removed dnsbl-1.uceprotect.net from rtbl list, because they
were erroneously blocking superdupergames.org 63.231.195.112

remaining spam blacklists are
bl.spamcop.net
sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org

had steadfast add a "spf" record to the domain service, so boardspace
designates itself as a permitted sender of email.
