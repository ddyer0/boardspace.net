Add the new language to the list in cgi-bin/tlib/common.pl

Add the new language to the translations table enum in the database

These first two steps are enough for translations to begin.

Add a new class to the languages list

Add the new class to the kawa compile script

Run upload/download strings

Also, presumably the motivation for adding a new language is to add a
new translator.  Use the admin web interface to edit the player and
give them the "is translator" permission.
