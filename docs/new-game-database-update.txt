Steps to add a new game to the database.

Generally, everything here has to be done twice, once to the development
database on your local machine, and again on the live database.  It's not
critical when, except of course the changes have to be made sometime before
the game goes live.

Open the database using Mysql Workbench or similar tool of your choice.

Add a new row to the "variations" table.  This contains several crucial
things which also have to be known to the GameInfo entry for the game.

These next two items trigger massive internal changes in mysql which alter
every record.  I've never had any trouble resulting, but be cautious.

Use "edit table" to change the enum "variations" in EITHER the zertz_gamerecord
or the mp_gamerecord table.  Zertz-gamecord for strictly 2 player games, mp_gamerecord
for games with potentially more than 2 players.

Use edit table to change the enum "variations" in the "ranking" table.

Sometime after these changes are made to the database, the game server has 
to be restarted.  The restart script extracts the new data from the database
and configures the server.   In particular, the "directory number" and 
corresponding physical directory location of the new game needs to be known
to the server.

The new game's short name (2 letter name) and full name, and directory number
need to be installed in the new game's GameInfo record, and naturally must
agree with the database values.
