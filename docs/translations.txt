Boardspace translations for languages other than English are stored
in an online database, which can be editing using the script
https://boardspace.net/cgi-bin/translation.cgi

Permission to use this script is granted by the "is_translator" property
of a user account at boardspace.  Which can be set using the script
https://boardspace.net/cgi-bin/edit.cgi with the supervisor capability

The primary list of keys in the translations comes from 2 sources, #1 is
the set of cgi scripts themselves, which self-create keys simply by using
them.  #2 is all the java files in the system.   Conventionally, java
source files maintain lists of keys, most of which are "self keys" where
the key is also the english translation.  

The java project "boardspace strings" collects the keys from all the active
files, uploads them to the database, does some maintenance, and downloads
the resulting database as a set of "<languagename>.data" files.  These
are positioned so that the build script for new desktop releases will 
automatically include the latest translations. 

The translations for desktop are bundled as though the were a game, in 
"languages.jar".  

The translations for mobiles have to be manually edited into "languages.res"

The overall structure is intended so that the exact set of strings in the
active apps isn't a critical factor; if anything is out of sync with the
latest distributed apps, nothing bad will happen.

If anything ever does seriously damage the translations database, it can be 
recovered (with considerable inconvenience) from the database backups.  In
principle it could also be reconstructed from the language data files, but
there isn't a program to do that.
