Other things you will need to be a full-stack developer

A L.A.M.P. type web site.   Lots of vendors provide these.  Boardspace currently
rents a low end VM from steadfast.net.  About $50/month.

To deploy jar files that are acceptable to java web start, you'll need a code
signing certificate and a hardware dongle.  The system is organized around 
corporate customers, but it's possible to buy a "personal certificate" after
jumping through some hoops.    Certicates cost from $60-$250 per year.  The
cheapest vendor I've found is SSL.com.   Hardware dongles cost $60 and up.
I use a usb dongle from Yubico


To develop mobile versions, you'll need to pay for a subscription to the
codenameone.com build service, $25/month.  It's technically possible to 
avoid this by building your own, but that involves a number of other hassles.
... and besides, codename1 deserves support.  It's great.

To develop IOS versions, you'll need to sign up with the apple developer program,
$100/year.   You'll also absolutely have to have access to a reasonably modern
Mac to upload new app versions to the apple app store.

To develop android versions, you'll need a google developer account.  Free
(or maybe with a small 1 time fee, I forget).
