# boardspace.net
Backups and Clone/Reconstruction sources for Boardspace.net

There are 3 main areas of interest. 

Server contains the files necessary to build boardspace.net on top of a standard L.A.M.P platform
or a Windows platform.  Some assembly required, to say the least, but everything you need should
be there.

Client contains sources necessary to build the client programs that connect to the server and play
the games.  Major sub-branches exist for the desktop, pure java, client program, and for the 
codename1 port for IOS and Android

Docs contains information about how to put it all together.  A lot of arcane knowlege is needed to 
turn these raw resources into a working game site, look here for hints.
