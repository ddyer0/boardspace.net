   REGISTER handle email_address real_first_name real_last_name

Create an account with the handle you wish to be called by while you are
on the server.  After typing this command, you will receive a password at
the email address you have given.  As soon as you get the message, usually
within a few minutes, you can log on at FIGS using the handle that you
have asked to use and the password you have received, both of which will
be in the letter.  (Please record them immediately.)

QUICK-START EXAMPLES: 

  "Register geek geek@imageek.york.cuny.edu Erik Van Riper": will register
  the handle "geek" and send the password to "geek@imageek.york.cuny.edu"
  with the real full name of "Erik Van Riper". 

  "Register xzhou xunzhou@CS.SunySB.edu Zhou Xun": will register the handle
  "xzhou" and send the password to "xunzhou@CS.SunySB.edu Zhou Xun" with
  the real full name of "Zhou Xun". 

NOTE:  We ask for your name so we can say "Hi Erik!" and be more friendly.  :)

PLEASE BE CAREFUL to spell your email address correctly.
