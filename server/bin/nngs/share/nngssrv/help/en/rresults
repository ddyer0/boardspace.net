USAGE: rresults [user]

Results gives you your (or specified user) history of RATED games.

Note that these are *potentially* rated games (that is, they were not
"free", and not against NR-players, nor unregistered players). They
may not yet have been included in your rating. (For instance if an
opponent only had a set rank but not rating when the game was played,
and he/she still has no rating.)

Here is a sample:
