USAGE: touch white-black

This can be used to keep a stored (adjourned) game "alive", preventing its
removal.

First, type "stored" to see your stored games.

For example...  if you are "Rott" and you type "stored", you get:

Stored games for Rott:
               rott-byakko                  ydk-rott
Found 2 stored games.


To touch the game ydk-rott you type

touch ydk-rott

This resets the "age" on the game.
