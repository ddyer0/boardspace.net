lonely heroes

outcasts persecuted in their home lands
seek freedom in the new world
pioneers venturing into the wilderness
their life is lonely and their work is hard
hearts yearning for loved ones left behind
unable to turn back, they press on
future generations will thank them
for their sacrifice today
