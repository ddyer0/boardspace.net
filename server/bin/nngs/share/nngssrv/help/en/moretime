USAGE: addtime [minutes]
ALIAS: moretime

Adds extra time (in minutes) to your opponent's clock when you are
playing a game.  

In essence, using the addtime command means that you don't want your
opponent to worry so much about the time remaining on his/her clock, about
being flagged, and so on.  It is a useful command to use when your opponent
mentions a problem with his/her connection (netlag).

You are under no obligation to give your opponent more time, of course.  If
you find that you frequently need more time when you play, consider playing
with longer time controls.

Note that you can play an untimed game by specifying 0 minutes initial time
and 0 minutes byo-yomi in the "match" command.
