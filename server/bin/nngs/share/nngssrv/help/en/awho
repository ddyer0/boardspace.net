USAGE: awho
ALIAS: user users

Supplements the old "who" command which, on NNGS, doesn't give enough
information for choosing an opponent.  One of the most frequently used
commands, "awho" gives a list of players currently on the server in order
of ladder position. 

QUICK-START EXAMPLES:

  awho        gives a list of everyone on the server, in Ladder19 position
              order, with special information added.
  awho 9      gives the same list in Ladder9 position order
  awho f      lists those not playing, in Ladder19 position order
  awho *      lists ladder games now happening
  awho r      (same as above) lists ladder games now happening

THE OPTIONS (which can be changed with the "toggle" command):
  awho        gives a complete list of all players and games in Ladder19
              position order
  9           gives a complete list of all players and games in Ladder9
              position order
  f           shows only free players (not playing)
  r           show only registered players
  u           show only unregistered players

EXPLANATION OF "AWHO" EXAMPLES ABOVE:

Daveg, the first entry, is playing in game 1, which is a ladder game as
evidenced by the "*".  He claims 1 dan, is No. 2 on the Ladder19 and has
not entered the Ladder9, and explains that he is 1 dan* on IGS, an AGA 4
dan, and a 3 "gup" in Korea. 

The second player, geek, is observing game 1, reports himself as 4 kyu, is
No. 5 on the Ladder19 and No. 3 on the Ladder9, and explains that he has a
3 kyu rating from the AGA (American Go Association).

programmer as 13 kyu, is No. 6 on the Ladder19 and has not yet entered the
Ladder9, and repeats his 13k claim without further explanation.

game, reports himself as 3k, is No. 17 on the 19 ladder and No. 1 on the 9
ladder, doesn't want a game, and explains himself as really being 6 dan

Todd reports himself as 7 kyu, and explains his rating with the word
"Amanda" (huh?).
