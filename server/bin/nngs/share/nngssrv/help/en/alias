USAGE: alias [word [string]]

Sets up a command alias so that "word" is equivalent to typing "string".
If "string" is omitted then the current value of "word" is displayed. If
both parameters are omitted, then all of your aliases are displayed.

  "alias" -- lists all aliases you have created
  "alias word"  -- gives your alias for "word"
  "alias word string" -- creates/updates an alias for you so that typing
                         "word" is equivalent to typing "string"

Note 1: Aliases are not transitive. This sequence of commands --

    alias foo bar
    alias bar baz

will NOT result in "foo" being equivalent to "baz".

Note 2: You may not create an alias for the quit command.

Here are standard aliases (everyone has them by default):
  a             accept
  bye           quit
  exit          quit
  h             help
  hi            history
  logout        quit
  m             match
  p             who a
  players       who a
  sh            shout  [note: this alias may have been disabled]
  t             tell
  vars          variables
  w             who
  .             tell .
  ,             tell ,
  !             shout
  ?             help 
  ^             tell the-last-person-who-told-you-something
