   
USAGE: mail me name_of_game
   
With this command, you can mail any recently completed game on
the SGF list to the email address that is in your stats. The game
information will include the record of the moves, the names of the 
players, their ranks and colors, the komi (compensation points for 
white), the date, the name of the winner, the score, and even the 
kibitz remarks of observers. 
   
EXAMPLE: 
   
#> mail me shong-ph-9707232315

(In this number, "97" is the year, "07" is the month, "23" is 
the day, and "2315" is the time.)
   
   
WHEN "mail me" DOESN'T WORK:
   
If the game hasn't been completed, it will be on the "stored" 
list. However, it will not be on the SGF list and you won't be 
able to mail it.

If the game is an old one, it will no longer be on the SGF 
list and you won't be able to mail it.
   
      
NOTES ABOUT "mail me":
   
Be careful to type the name of the game exactly, and don't forget
the dashes.

If your Go client program can read a game record, you can use 
the one you mailed yourself to replay the game on your computer.
Otherwise, there are special  programs that will be able to read 
them using the SGF standard.
   
      
OTHER HELPFUL COMMANDS:
      
To get a list of games that are available for mailing, do not use 
the "results" command, but use the command:

#> sgf username

EXAMPLE: 

#> sgf shong   


You can arrange for the server to automatically send you all your 
games by email, as soon as they are completed, with the command:

#> toggle automail

Or you can use the same command to make the server stop mailing 
your games automatically.
