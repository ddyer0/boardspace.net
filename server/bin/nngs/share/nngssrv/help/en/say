USAGE: say message

Transmits your message to your current opponent if you are playing a
game. If you are not playing a game, the message is sent to the last
opponent in your current NNGS session. The short command is ",".

Unlike a "tell", a "say" is saved in the game record (sgf-file), just
like a kibitz.
