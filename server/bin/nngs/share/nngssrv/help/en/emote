USAGE: emote type player [args...]

Emote is an interesting command.  (The shorthand for this is /).

emote \i-'mo-t\ v : to give expression to emotion esp. in or as if 
                    in a play or movie

An example of the usage is:

/five tromp

That will send tromp (if your handle is OneEye)

^ OneEye's hand floats through the air and slaps you a high five! ^

There is a special emote, "/balloon".  You have a certain number of
these in your "variables".  You get more by winning games.  The way
these work are:

/balloon tromp red

and tromp will see:

^ You see a red blob at the horizon getting closer ....
And suddenly OneEye's water balloon hovers above your head!
Splosh!! The balloon explodes all over the Go Board and everything is wet!
You look across the room and OneEye grins guiltily... ^

Most emotes do not need a third parameter, we will detail them here when 
there is new ones added.

As for the current emotes:

wave     scratch    kiss    scalpel  five    lag  
balloon  hug        bow     pat      peck    smack
tap      lazy       smile   pie      pout    vday (Valentines day)  
miss     warm       bonk    cny (Chinese new year)

New emotes can be added at any time, simply "tell geek" the new emote,
or better, send email with it, and he will add it in.

Have fun!
