USAGE: best ladder-number range

Displays a complete list, in order, of the 19 x 19 ladder.  If specified,
it will display the named ladder and only players in certain positions. 

QUICK-START EXAMPLES: 

  "Best" will display the best player on the server in the 19x19 ladder. 

  "Best 19" lists all members of Ladder19, in position order. 

  "Best 9" lists all members of Ladder9, in position order.

  "Best 19 7-12" lists only positions 7 to 12 of the Ladder19.

  "Best 9 1-22" lists only positions 1-22 of the Ladder9.

CAUTION: If you want a range of positions, you must specify the ladder
number.  Therefore, "best 3-12" will not work.
