USAGE: channel [channel_number]

Enter or later exit from a channel, which is like a private room
where a few people can talk.  Others on the server who are not in
the channel will not hear what is said in it.  Using channels is
preferable to, and often more fun than, shouting a lot since it
doesn't disturb as many people who may be concentrating on their
games.

If no channel_number is given "channel" lists all the existing
channels.

SUGGESTED EXAMPLE STEPS:

   1) Type "inchannel" to see the people listed by channel.
   2) Next, for example, if channel 33 looks like the place you would 
      like to join, type "channel 33".
   3) Use "tell channel_number" to start talking with the people in a
      channel.  For example, you might type "tell 33 hiya how are ya", and
      the other people on the channel will get your comment.
   4) Now your abbreviation ";" means the same as "tell 33".  Thus, if you
      type  "; I am fine thanks", channel 33 will get your comment.
   5) To exit channel 33, please type "channel 33" again.

TECHNICAL COMMENTS:

   1) Your active channels are saved between logins.
   2) Typing "channel" by itself will list all channels.
