USAGE: pzz user text

If the user OneEye enters the command:

  pzz tromp grabs her sword and charges at you screaming!

then tromp will see:

  ^ OneEye grabs her sword and charges at you screaming! ^

This is like a "personal zz" or a "personal it".  

The * key will contain "pzz tromp" if OneEye wanted to send another pzz,
just like a . in tell.

SEE ALSO: zz it
