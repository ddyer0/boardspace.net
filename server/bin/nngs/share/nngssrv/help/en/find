USAGE: find [-]name

Used to find users by user name or email address.

Example:  find sss

returns

    Matched player: sss         at address sss@iohk.com
    Matched player: sssg        at address sss@iohk.com

and       find -iohk

returns

    Matched player: chl         at address chl@iohk.com
    Matched player: spirt       at address maxng@iohk.com
    Matched player: sss         at address sss@iohk.com
    Matched player: sssg        at address sss@iohk.com

In other words, if there is no -, then you search the username part of the
email address.  If you add a - in front, it returns any part of the email
address that matches what you place after the -.

The find database is updated once every 24 hours, so new registrations
are not found until after the next update.
