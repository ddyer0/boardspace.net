USAGE: beep user

Beep can be used to get the attention of "user", for instance when you
suspect he/she is not looking at the server window.
It sends a ^G (ctrl-G), and the message "... is beeping you", to "user".
If "user" has been idle for some time, beep prints the idle time.

NOTE:  This may or may not produce an actual sound, or blink, at the "user"'s
       end, it is up to "user"'s client.
