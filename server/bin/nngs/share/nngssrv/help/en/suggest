   
USAGE: suggest opponent1 [opponent2]
   
The suggest command lets the NNGS computer make a recommendation
for the correct number of handicap stones and the komi value against
an opponent. It also can get you the same information about two other
players.
   
   
EXAMPLE 1:
   
   (You are pem, with a rating of 2653, and eek has a rating of 2921.)
   
   You type:      suggest eek
   
   You get back:  I suggest that pem play Black against eek:
                  For 19x19:  Take 3 handicap stones and set komi to -2.5.
                  For 13x13:  Take 1 handicap stones and set komi to -6.5.
                  For   9x9:  Take 1 handicap stones and set komi to 0.5.   
   
   
EXAMPLE 2: 
   
   (You are still pem.)
   
   You now type:  suggest Erik shong
   
   You get back:  I suggest that Erik play Black against shong:
                  For 19x19:  Take 9 handicap stones and set komi to 5.5.
                  For 13x13:  Take 3 handicap stones and set komi to -2.5.
                  For   9x9:  Take 2 handicap stones and set komi to 1.5.   
   
NOTES:
   
If you are NR, or if you do not yet have a rating, then the server
cannot suggest anything.  The same goes for the opponent you choose.
