Introduction to the Go Teaching Ladder
======================================

Several high dan players have recommended getting your own games
reviewed by stronger players as a good way to make progress.
However it is not always easy to find stronger players willing to
comment your games.

The Go Teaching Ladder (GTL) has been set up for this purpose.
Volunteers in the ladder comment games made by weaker players.
Anyone may submit a game for commenting by a stronger player.

Getting your own game reviewed
------------------------------

In order to have one of your games commented on, just follow
these three steps:

 1. Get the SGF file of the game you've played.
    See 'help mail' and 'help sgf' on the go servers.
    Don't send easy wins or fast games (at least 20 minutes total
    playing time per person)!! Have a look at
    "Which games should be submitted for review?" in the FAQ.

 2. Go over the game yourself and add questions or comments.
    These comments can serve as a guideline for the reviewer.
    Furthermore the reviewer can concentrate on those aspects
    or moves that are of most interest to you.
        
 3. Send this SGF file to <gtl@jeudego.org> - we'll forward your
    game to a proper reviewer. Please don't forget to tell us if
    you played black or white.
    Alternativly you can select a reviewer on your own.
    Please consult the FAQ on how to do it.

That's it. You should receive your review within two weeks.
Don't forget to thank the reviewer for the review. Not doing so is
extremly impolite.


The ladder will work best if those who get their games commented also
volunteer in turn to comment on the games of weaker players. In order

Please read the FAQ before using the ladder or sending email to the 
administrator.
