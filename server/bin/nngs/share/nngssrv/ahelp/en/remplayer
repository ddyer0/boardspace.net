USAGE: remplayer name

RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

Deletes an account. A copy of its files are saved under .rem.* which can
be found in the appropriate directory (in case of accident).
   
The account details, messages, games and logons are all saved as 'zombie'
files. These zombie accounts are not listed in handles nor total.

NOTES: Removing a player can be very BAD IDEA! In particular, NEVER remove
       an account which has, or had, a rating. (Inactive accounts will
       expire automatically, eventually.)

       It is not possible to revive a removed account from within the server.

       The only safe use is removing new accounts with offensive names
       or faulty email addresses (failed registrations).

       To stop access please do "asetpasswd name *" instead.
