`iprange' can be either a range, or a single ip-address.
Overlapping or touching ranges are automatically combined.
Removing a range from the middle of an existing range will
cause it to be split in two. The ranges are maintained in
memory, a persistent copy is also kept in a file, which is
read at startup. When ranges are altered (using one of the
+-*/ commands) , aban does not touch affect connected
sessions. Use `aban !' explicitely to remove these.
