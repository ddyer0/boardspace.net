You can use +/-/= to change and view the lists.

Examples:

  +listname member    (Add member to listname)

  -listname member    (Remove member from listname)

  =listname           (View the members of listname)

  =                   (View the names of all the lists and see level)

NOTE: The lists are not actually used (except the list "admin").
