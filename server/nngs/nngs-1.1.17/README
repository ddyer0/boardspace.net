-- NNGS SERVER README
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The files contained in this tarball comprise the No Name Go Server
(NNGS) source code.

For licencing information, see the file COPYING.


>> COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION

Before compiling, read and edit src/nngsconfig.h and src/nngsmain.h
Things like mail program locations are specified therein.
You may also want to check config.h after running ./configure

Configure and compile mlrate and then NNGS.  Here's how:
(current version numbers may be different...)

tar xvzf mlrate-1.0.xx.tar.gz
cd mlrate-1.0.xx
./configure
make
cd ..

_READ_ the README file in the mlrate directory.  It contains much useful
information on how to set up the ratings system to work properly.

tar xvzf nngs-1.1.yy.tar.gz
cd nngs-1.1.yy
ln -s ../mlrate-1.0.xx mlrate
./configure --prefix=/whatever/dir/you/want
make install

The 'make install' command installs the server and all basic
help files necessary for its functionality.
All files needed by the server are installed under the --prefix.
Once running, the server will put all of it's data (players,games,logfile)
under this prefix, too. This may grow ...

To run and test it:
$prefix/bin/nngssrv
telnet localhost 9696

>> DATA FILES

Data and logfiles will be in $prefix/share/nngssrv/*

Several files need to be installed manually to avoid damage
when you update an existing server.

In $prefix/share/nngssrv/ladder you will find two example ladder
files.  Copy them (or remame them) to remove the '.example'

In $prefix/share/nngssrv/messages you will find default message
files for login, logout, etc.  Rename them to remove the 'default.'
part to activate them.


>> USERS AND ADMINS

When you install NNGS for the first time, you'll need to manually
create a user with 'admin' - rights. This can be ANY valid name.
Once there is an admin-account, it can be used to grant admin-rights
to other users.
NOTE: the admin-status is stored in TWO places: the userfile proper,
and a lists/admin - file. You'l need both.
There already is a user 'admin' in the lists/admins.default -file
, you'll need to
1) create a user named 'admin' by logging in and using
   the 'register' -command, and lgging out.
2) manually edit the user file for 'admin' in .../players/a/admin:
   change the line:
VARS: 1:4:0:1:0:1:1:0 :0:1:1:0:1:1:0:0 :0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 :0:4:1:3:90:19:10:25 :33:0:0:33
   to:
VARS: 1:4:0:1:0:1:1:0 :0:1:1:0:1:1:0:0 :0:100:0:0:0:0:0:0 :0:4:1:3:90:19:10:25 :33:0:0:33
   (this field is the adminLevel)---------^^^
3) on the next logon, the 'admin' account will have unlimited rights.
