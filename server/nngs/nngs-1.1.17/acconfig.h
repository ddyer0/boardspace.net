/* acconfig.h
   This file is in the public domain.

   Descriptive text for the C preprocessor macros that
   the distributed Autoconf macros can define.
   No software package will use all of them; autoheader copies the ones
   your configure.in uses into your configuration header file templates.

   The entries are in sort -df order: alphabetical, case insensitive,
   ignoring punctuation (such as underscores).  Although this order
   can split up related entries, it makes it easier to check whether
   a given entry is in the file.

   Leave the following blank line there!!  Autoheader needs it.  */


/* Define for admin levels */
#undef ADMINLEVELS

/* The concatenation of the strings "GNU ", and PACKAGE.  */
#undef GNU_PACKAGE

/* Define if the preprocessor recognizes __FUNCTION__ */
#undef HAVE___FUNCTION__

/* Define to the mail program found */
#undef MAILPROGRAM

/* Define to the name of the distribution.  */
#undef PACKAGE

/* Define to 1 if ANSI function prototypes are usable.  */
#undef PROTOTYPES

/* Define to 1 if termcap/terminfo is available.  */
#undef TERMINFO

/* Define to 1 if using dmalloc */
#undef USING_DMALLOC

/* Define to the version of the distribution.  */
