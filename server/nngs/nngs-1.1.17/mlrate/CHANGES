1.2     Added "no update option" (-u) to anchor. This makes it possible
        to reset the anchoring state after manually adjusted sval.
        Circular dependency check now drops the player with the fewest
        number of games.
        Fixed bugs in the "directory db" functions, player entries are now
        actually created.

1.1     Added check for circular dependencies, various minor bug fixes,
        removed temporary NNGS-specific stuff, made it compile quietly
        on Linux with -Wall even, and made it compile on FreeBSD.
        (Also moved it from sccs to cvs on the internal development
         platform; all sccsid variables were removed, email addresses
         and copyright headers updated.)

1.0.3   Fixed sign bug in anchor and "ignore" parsing in mlrate.

1.0.2   Fixed the Makefile and installation routines. Doesn't require
        gnu-make any more.

1.0.1   Some minor bug fixes.

1.0     First release.
