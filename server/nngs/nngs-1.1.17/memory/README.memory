These are the memory allocation routines present in the 1.0.0 NNGS
version.  They are replaced by the system memory management routines,
and the debugging capability they provided is replaced in part by the
dmalloc memory debugging library.  They can still be compiled in with a
definition of USE_PEM_MALLOC in config.h

--Nils.
