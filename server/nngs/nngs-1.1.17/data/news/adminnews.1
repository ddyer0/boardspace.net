WUAH and MUHA!!!!

I finally succeeded in making this function - so USE it! :)

A brief documentary:

news [optional number]
anews [optional number]
createnews [Headline text only]
createadmnews [Headline text only]

Need I say more? :)    oh yes - as a little 'kick', I decided to make 
this better than on ICC :)   doing 'news' shows you the news SINCE LAST 
LOGIN. Much cooler than just showing the 10 latest :p   Anyway to see the 
whole list, do 'news all'

The info shown when someone does 'news #number' is stored in a file 
called news.# and adminnews.# . There files must be placed manually in 
data/news directory.
