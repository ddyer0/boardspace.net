To get older versions of winigc (before 0.63) to work correctly here:

1)  register an account
2)  log out, get password in email
3)  log in 
4)  toggle client on
5)  log out

You can also put int your WINIGC.INI file:

[Parser]
DetectIGS=0

And WinIGC will assume it is on IGS.

The next time you log in, everything will work OK.  "user" is different here,
so you will get that output in your terminal window.
