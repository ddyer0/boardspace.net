   
USAGE: done
   
This is the final command to end a game.
   
First each player passes and the dead stones are removed. If
you want to, you can then check the points for both players with
the "score" command. However, after both players have typed "done"
the NNGS computer will count and announce the score and then allow
the players to start new games. 
   
NOTE: After both players have typed "done", it is no longer 
possible to undo or change anything about the game. Before you type 
"done", we recommend that you first use the "score" command so that 
you can make sure you have cleaned up the board completely. If a 
player has forgotten to remove one or more dead stones, you will see 
that the score is incorrect, and you will have a chance to remove 
any dead stones before typing "done".
