A GoBot can show professional games from a collection listed in an index,
and games played by players on NNGS (as long as they are kept).

Take a look at the index:

 help index

or, for a the reverse order,

 help rindex

or to email it to yourself: (1447 lines, about 80KB)

 mhelp index

on WWW: http://nngs.cosmic.org

Then, when GoBot is not playing a game, type:

 tell gobot #

where # is the number you want.  (Do not use the # sign itself  :)

You can also leave the choice to GoBot by typing:

 tell gobot random

To get GoBot to show a game played by players on NNGS, chose a game for
a given player (with the sgf command) and tell GoBot its name:

 tell gobot player1-player2-yymmddhhmm

You can also tell GoBot to start at a move by giving the move number
as a second argument.

 tell gobot # #
 tell gobot random #
 tell gobot player1-player2-yymmddhhmm #

To get it to skip faster a number (#) of moves of a game you requested, do

 tell gobot jump #

To get it to abort a game you requested, simply:

 tell gobot abort

When all GoBots are busy a new GoBot is automatically logged in (but the
number is limited and small). Should all present GoBots be busy a new may
appear if the main GoBot (named "gobot") is told "duplicate".
