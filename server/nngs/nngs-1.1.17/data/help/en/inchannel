USAGE: inchannel [0-99]
       channels [0-99]

Displays a list of all users currently tuned to the named
channel. If the channel number is omitted, displays a list of ALL
existing channels

  For example, you may see a channel that looks like:

Channel 33: (-) Geeks place
 geek

That shows that geek is in channel 33, and the channel has no status (-).
If you saw:

Channel 33: (L) Geeks place
 geek

That means the channel is locked to further people entering the channel
(possibly a private discussion).

If you saw:

Channel 33: (D) Geeks place
 geek

That means the channel has the Do Not Disturb flag set.  This means you have
to be in the channel to yell into it.
