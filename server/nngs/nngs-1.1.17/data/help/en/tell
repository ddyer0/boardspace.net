USAGE: tell handle [comment]

Send your remark to another person.  The person receiving your remark will
see your handle (which is your name on the server) surrounded by asterisks
and followed by the remark.  Depending on the client, the receiver will
also hear a beep or see a flash on the screen.  Caution: a command does
not include the quotes (") surrounding it. 

If no comment is given, it simply sets your "." to handle.

QUICK-START EXAMPLE ("donw" is your handle or name on this server):

  Command:  "tell KenW Hello, how are you?" (This command, without the
            quotes, is: tell KenW Hello, how are you?) 
   Result:  KenW will see, "*donw*: Hello, how are you?" (and no quotes)

HINT: To see if you are doing it correctly, you can practice some of these
      commands on yourself.  Try "tell your_own_handle Hiya! :)"  For 
      example, "tell donw Hiya! :)".  (Remember to use your own handle
      though.)


ADVANCED TIME-SAVING SHORTHANDS:

. [comment] Send your remark to the last person YOU USED "tell" WITH 
            during this connection to the server. A single "." with no
            comment will print the current setting of ".".

^ comment   Send your remark to last person WHO USED "tell" WITH YOU during
            this connection to the server.  By using "^" you have no need
            to spell out the person's name.  You can continue after using 
            "^" by reusing it, or with "." 

EXAMPLES OF THE ADVANCED TIME-SAVING TECHNIQUES (again, as in the first
example, you are "donw" and the other person is "Kenw"): 

  Command:  ".you didn't answer me before, hi"    
   Result:  KenW will now see, "*donw*: you didn't answer me before, hi"

    First:  KenW types "tell donw How are you today?"
   Result:  You will see "*KenW*: How are you today?"
   Second:  Now you type only: "^ fine"
   Result:  KenW sees "*donw*: fine"
	    (He has gotten your message without your spelling out his name!)

     Also:  Later in the conversation, you can use either "." or "^"
