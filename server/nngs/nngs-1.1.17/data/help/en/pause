USAGE: pause

Requests from your opponent that the game your are playing be paused.
If your opponent has given you a pause request, using the pause command (or
accept) will accept the pause request.  You may decline a pause request
by using the decline command.
  
This rolls back the clocks to the time of the last move. To unpause a
game use "unpause".
