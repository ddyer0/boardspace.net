Short biography of Mr. Huang Cheng Jun, 5 dan professional.

Mr Huang Cheng Jun was one of the first class of young go players (pro)
of China (as said in CHINESE GO, a journal in China), and played as one
of the major players for go teams of Heilongjiang and Liaoning (two
provinces of China in the Northeastern area) during the 1960's-1980's.
After he retired from the pro go team, he has been working as the coach
of Go in Shenyang amatuer sports school for young people (shenyang is
the capital city of Liaoning province).  Many of his students are
active at all kinds of amatuer go matches, many are 5d or 4d now, and,
DNJIANG (Jiang Danning), who is now very famous in the AGA, had learned
from Mr. Huang at a very young age before he went to study in BEIJING
university.
