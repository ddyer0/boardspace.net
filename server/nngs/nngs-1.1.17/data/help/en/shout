USAGE: shout message

Displays your one-line message to other users.  Except for the shouter and
those who have disabled this command, the others will see your handle
surrounded with exclamation marks and followed by the message.  You can
also use the shortcut, or alias, of "!" instead of "shout". 

QUICK-START EXAMPLES (where "player" is your handle or name on this server):

   Command:  shout Please help a newbie.
    Result:  !player!: Please help a newbie.

   Command:  !Please help a newbie.
    Result:  !player!: Please help a newbie.

DISABLING YOUR SHOUTS--if they wish, others can do the following:

   Use "toggle s" to stop all incoming shouts.

   Use "censor player" to stop all tells and shouts *from you* from now on.

IMPORTANT HINT: please use shout only if it is necessary for everyone to
hear your comment.  Otherwise, it is wise, and considerate, to use tell to
speak with specific individuals, or to enter a channel to have fun with a
few people.

TECHNICAL NOTE: A shout surrounded by double exclamations marks is coming
from the server management.  For example, "!!Pro game in five minutes!!"
is an announcement from the administration of NNGS.
