The Imagination

the only nation worth defending
a nation without alienation
a nation whose flag is invisible
and whose borders are forever beyond the horizon
a nation whose motto is why have one or the other
when you can have one the other and both
a nation whose badge is a chrysanthenum of sweet wrappings
maybe
a nation whose laws are magnificent
whose customs are not barriers
whose uniform is multiform
whose anthem is improvised
whose hour is imminent
and whose poetry does not have many laughs
