We at NNGS wish to credit the Free Internet Chess Server folks for giving us
their source code to start from.  Thanks!

                     the original server. Without him, the chess server
		     might not exist.

  Daniel Sleator -   Author of AICS and responsible for many of the ideas
                     that makes the chess server as popular as it is.
