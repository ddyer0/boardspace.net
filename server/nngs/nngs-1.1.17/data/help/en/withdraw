USAGE: withdraw [1-n, match, adjourn, all, player]

Withdraws an offer that you have made. If no parameter is given and
there is only one offer, the withdraw command with rescind your offer. If
you have more than one offer pending (for example multiple match offers)
then you must specify which offer you want to withdraw. You can choose the
offer by number, by type, all offers, or by the player's name to whom you
are making the offer.

NOTE: Several types of requests are withdrawn by NNGS automatically in
      certain situations.  For example, if you have made a match request to
      user2 but then accept a match request from user1, NNGS starts your
      match with user1 and withdraws your offer to user2.
