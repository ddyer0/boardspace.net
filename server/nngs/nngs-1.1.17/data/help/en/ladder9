USAGE: ladder9 range

This command is equivalent to the "best" command, where the first
argument is 9.  For example, typing

  ladder9 3-10

is the same as typing

  best 9 3-10

Both commands will display positions 3 through 10 on the 9x9
ladder.  If no RANGE is given then the entire ladder will be
displayed.

See "help best" for a full description.
