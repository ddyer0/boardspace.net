USAGE: ladder19 range

This command is equivalent to the "best" command, where the first
argument is 19.  For example, typing

  ladder19 3-10

is the same as typing

  best 19 3-10

Both commands will display positions 3 through 10 on the 19x19
ladder.  If no RANGE is given then the entire ladder will be
displayed.

See "help best" for a full description.
