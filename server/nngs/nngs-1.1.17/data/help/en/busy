USAGE: set busy string

Sets your "busy" string. When it is set, people will see when they
stats you or talk to you that you are busy.

Examples you might use are:
  set busy is really busy right now
  set busy will be back in 5 minutes
  set busy will be idle for a while...

Entering "set busy" by itself, clears your busy string
