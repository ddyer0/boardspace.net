Earth, Fire, Water, Air,
These we live with,
But take no care.
When those around us,
Pass on and leave us,
We wonder where they went,
Not where WE are going.
Even when you realize,
That life is finite
We work ourselves to death.
And for what?  Just a meal.
Why should we live to work
And pass our days
As slave to Earth.
We pollute the air
And even ourselves.

                      -E. Van Riper  12/14/83
