Cgoban, short for "Complete Goban", is a general Go tool for all Unix/X11
platforms.  It can act as a client to any of the go servers, it can view
and edit SGF files, it can be used as a go board to play on locally, and it
can communicate via the Go Modem Protocol.

The latest version of Cgoban is always available on the web at
"http://www.hevanet.com/wms/comp/cgoban/".  This web server has a poor
connection, so you may not be able to get ther.  If you can't, you can also
get the source code from the bsdserver FTP site and it's mirrors (these are
"igs.joyjoy.net", "ftp://rzis1.rz.tu-bs.de/pub/go", and others).

You can give any comments you have about cgoban to the author, Bill
Shubert, by email to "wms@hevanet.com" or by leaving a message for "wms" on
either NNGS or IGS.
