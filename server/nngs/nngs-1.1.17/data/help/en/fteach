USAGE: fteach

This command allows two players to turn a new game, or an in progress
game into an unrated teaching game.  This turns on kibitzes for the
players (to hear the questions or comments being kibitzed), and turns on
multi-undo as well (see help undo).

This command was created to replace doing teaching in channels, where
comments are not saved.

Please note that variations are not save, so some (most?) comments may
not make sense.  Perhaps some day this will not be the case.  :)

To use this, each player must type "fteach" sometime during the game.
