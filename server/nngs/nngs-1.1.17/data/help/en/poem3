A room
Filled
   with
      peace
        and
War.
                                      On one side
                                      There is
                                      Peace

The other
There is
War.

                  In the middle
                  There is
                  Earth.

     And filling the space between War and Earth
     And filling the space between Earth and Peace
     There is human life,
       Sacrificed
          for
            War
              To
                make
                  Peace.

                             -- E. Van Riper  Jan 11, 1984
