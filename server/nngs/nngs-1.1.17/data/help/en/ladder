USAGE: ladder

At the beginning of a game, if the server determines that the
conditions are right it will tell you that this game can be a ladder
game.  At that point, if both players type "ladder" then the game
will be a ladder game.

How the ladders work:

A ladder is a continuous tournament with no handicaps in which
players must regularly compete for their positions.  The strongest
player holds the #1 position, the next-strongest player holds #2,
and so forth.

There are two separate ladders: 9x9 and 19x19.  If a ladder game is
not played for one week after your last COMPLETED one, you are
dropped 1 position in the ladder.

PROCEDURE: begin with the normal match command, the player with the
higher position (closest to 1) takes white.  If the server detects
that conditions are correct for a ladder game, then the players are
invited to type "ladder".  If both so respond, the server then
announces the commencement of a ladder tournament game!  All ladder
games are even, with a 5.5 komi (server sets the komi).

At the end of the game, the server immediately calculates the shift
in ladder positions.  If black (always the challenger) wins they
replace the position of white, who then drops only one position.  If
the challenger loses, nothing changes.

EXAMPLE: Todd, who is in position #7, challenges tromp, who holds
position #1 and will take white with a 5.5 komi.  If he wins, todd
becomes #1 and tromp becomes #2.  If todd loses, the positions
remain unchanged.  Todd would then remain at #7, and tromp at #1.
