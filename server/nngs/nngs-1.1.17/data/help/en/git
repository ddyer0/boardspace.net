USAGE: git message

This is a fun, stylish command, but does the same thing as shout.  This is
a "Go related it"

Display your one-line message to other users.  Except for the shouter and
those who have disabled their shouts, the others will see an arrow
followed by your handle and the message.  

QUICK-START EXAMPLES (where "player" is your handle or name on this server):

    Command:  git says please help the newbie.
     Result:  --> john says please help the newbie. 
 
DISABLING YOUR "GITS"--if they wish, others can do the following:

   Use "toggle gshout" to stop all incoming gshouts and "gits".

   Use "censor player" to stop all tells, shouts and "gits" *from you*
   from now on. 

IMPORTANT HINT: please use "git" only if it is necessary for everyone to
hear your comment.  Otherwise, it is wise, and considerate, to use tell to
speak with specific individuals, or to enter a channel to have fun with a
few people.
