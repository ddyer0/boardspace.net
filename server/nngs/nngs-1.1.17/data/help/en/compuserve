 How to access Go servers (IGS & NNGS) using Compuserve

 There are really only 2 differences between Compuserve (CIS) telnet
 and 'normal' telnet sessions.  1. ':' required between address & port
 number 2. LF line control instead of CR

 Understanding these two differences is all that is needed to connect
 with CIS, but I'll go into more detail for those (like me) who haven't
 a clue what they really mean.

 Difference #1 is simply a matter of including the ':' when typing the
 specific site address.  (igs.nuri.net:6969 for IGS and
 nngs.cosmic.org:9696 for NNGS)


 Some clients allow toggling of CR & LF within the client (Like winigc).
 This can overcome reason number 2, and should be sufficiant to make
 such clients work fine over CIS telnet.

 If your client doesn't have a CR-LF toggle, then you simply must toggle
 it with CIS.  While in CIS Telnet, use <CTRL-]> to jump out into the
 control invironment, where CIS will give you a menu option. Select
 option 2 (to toggle the CR/LF) and then return to telnet. In my
 experience, this is required every time, (scripts handle it well) but
 perhaps someone can point out a more permenant fix.

 That is all there is to it! Still, it may help to have a detailed,
 step-by- step walk-through, so here it is.

 If you do get garbage on the output below, it is no problem. Assume CIS
 is sending what I say it is, and there will be no problem.  If you
 really want it correct, simply switch the settings to 7 bit,even parity
 1 stop bit, and things should clear up. (I personally DON'T make this
 adjustment)

 I will assume that you are doing everything from the client, which is
 my preference personally.

 CIS shows  Type          Explaination

           ATDT####       dial up your
                          CIS node.
                          substitute
                          phone number
                          in '##'
 Host Name: CIS
 User ID:   ####          your ID ##
 password:  ****          your password
 <intro message>          just wait for
                          menu

 <menu>     Go Telnet     ignore options
                          just go telnet
 <menu>     8             select option
                          for access a
                          specific site
 site name: igs.nuri.net:6969
 <igs should come up now>
(or)
 site name: nngs.cosmic.org:9696
 <NNGS should come up now>

           CTRL-]         go to toggle
                          menu CR-LF
 <menu>     2             toggle it

 At this point, you should return to telnet to see the login screen as
 you left it.

 Login      NNNN          your acct name

 The rest is covered in the FAQ, about guest accounts, registering
 accounts and so on. You have a good connection to IGS now.  During a
 session, your CF should stay toggled by itself, until you leave Telnet,
 or CIS.

 Good luck!

 files or whatever.  Tailor as you see fit.
