USAGE: info [string]

Sets the first "Info:" line in your stats.

You may have up to 10 info lines.  This command sets the first info
line in your stats to [string].  If there are already other info lines
the new line will appear first (that is, above the other lines).

To set a specific info line, other than the first one, use:

  set 1 [string]
  set 2 [string]
    ...
  set 9 [string]

To erase a specific info line use the set command without any string.
For example, to erase info line 1 use "set 1".
