You can copy the latest clients from the following locations.
The easiest way is probably to use your web browser.  If you 
use plain FTP, be sure to use "binary" mode when transferring
files!

    ftp://www.joy.ne.jp/welcome/igs/Go/ (most up to date)
    ftp://rzis1.rz.tu-bs.de/pub/go      (may be out of date)
    ftp://ftp.fh-wuerzburg.de/pub/go/   (may be out of date)

Also be sure to check the NNGS web page (http://nngs.cosmic.org)
for clients that can run in your web browser.

There are many clients, ones for DOS, Windows, X11, Macintosh, Java,
OS/2, etc.
