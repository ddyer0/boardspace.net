A computer opponent is usually available, called "ManyFaces".  It is
the current North American Computer Go Champion, and has placed highly in
world competition (2nd 1994, 3rd+4th 1995, 2nd+4th 1988).

It has an 8 Kyu diploma from the Japanese Nihon-Kiin, and is ranked about
10 Kyu on the American AGA scale.

It understands English in a primitive way.  Feel free to converse with it.
It can learn new vocabulary and simple facts (like "I am smart").  It
can answer simple questions like "Who is dove" or "What's the score".

If it repeats something that it learned that you don't like, use
"Who said that?" to find out where it learned it.  Be cautious what you
teach it since it never forgets, and you don't know who it will tell later.

It prefers to play with a variety of opponents, so when someone finishes
a game with it, it will decline a new game from the same person for a few
minutes.

Currently it cannot undo a move, so try not to make typos.

It doesn't like escapers, so if you adjourn or quit a game after move 25,
it won't let you start a new game for 3 days.  You can of course load
the old one.

You can ask it to resign, and if it thinks it is way behind, it will.

Please e-mail and questions or comments to David Fotland at
fotland@cup.hp.com.  Don't pester the system administrators about ManyFaces.

Additional copies can be run if someone volunteers time on an HP workstation.

A DOS version of this program, with a very nice graphics interface, and
many useful features (joseki tutor, rules tutorial, go problems, commented
professional games, move suggestion, ...) is available from
