/* NOTE: lists don't seem fully implemented */

The lists themselsves are just filenames with the names of the accounts
in them.  They are indexed in the file 'index' with the name of the list
and the priveleges as follows:

/* -1 means no players but admin gods can edit, all may view it. */
-1 means that the list is invisible.  Useful for admin list.
0 means no players but admins can access it
1 means only read by non-admins
2 means that everyone can see/write to the list
