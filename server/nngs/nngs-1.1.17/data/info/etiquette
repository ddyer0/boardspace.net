  The goal of NNGS is to provide a friendly means for go enthusiasts to
play go games and discuss topics of interest.  In order to promote a
friendly atmosphere, NNGS follows simple guidelines and rules of etiquete.
NNGS admins have the authority to warn and (if necessary) sanction users who
violate these guidelines.

  NNGS users should refrain from making any statements or engaging in any
conduct that could be considered abusive, harrassing, offensive or
obscene, especially with regard to nationality, race, religion or sexual
orientation. Do not allow differences of opinion to escalate into personal
attacks.  If you want to avoid hearing statements made by a certain user,
use the censor command. 

  NNGS users should refrain from abusive conduct that ruins NNGS.  Such
conduct includes: (a) disconnecting in order to avoid losing a go match;
(b) losing a go match intentionally in order to inflate another user's
rating; (c) letting other people play rated matches using your registered 
account.

  It is good etiquette to have lengthy discussions about a topic or issue
using NNGS channels rather than shouts.  Special topics channels have been
created for this purpose (the channel help file has a listing).
