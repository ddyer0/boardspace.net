A lot of the admins on this server are here for programming reasons.
These admins are usually busy. Try to ask the Non-programmer admins for 
general help.  Here is a breakdown....

Programming admins:  cranium Cthulhu Dav foxbat Grimm Hawk hersco loon Mann 
                     Shane 

Double-duty admins:  Sparky

General admins:  equilibre Len schert Solid sveshi Sparky Thanatos TheDane

Note:  Admins have been chosen based on some simple but important criteria.
       Programmer admins obviously are chosen for ability and willingness
       to volunteer much time and energy toward the GNU-ICS project.
       In general, however, a good working knowledge of the game itself
       along with some practicle tournamant experience is quite valuable.
       Even more valuable is Tournamant directorship experience either on
       the club or national level.  Also of great value is a knowledge of
       different computers and operating systems and the ability to help
       new players with setting up interfaces and getting started toward
       their first game.  :-)
