This directory contains scripts for routine automation, and some
results of those scripts

directory "backup" contains backup copies of the tantrix player database
cron is the actual cron table

savedb is a script to save the database daily, with 7 levels of old 

savedb monthly saves a permanant backup monthly, and also performs
cleanup and maintenance on the db.  It should NOT be run at any 
other time, since part of its task is to maintain the "monthly rankings"
page.  Savedb-monthly also saves archive copies of the monthly standings,
permanant standings, and the map database.

savegames-if-enough is run daily, and triggers savegames if over a threshold number
of games have been played.  The two factors affecting the sweep frequency are that
many games is combersome, and some number, about 1000, begin to cause the shell
problems in savegames.

the script renew-ssl has to be run under root, but lives in this directory. It 
depends on the machinery from "letsencrypt" being present and set up already.
with something like this as the cron file
