<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Rules for Medina
(first edition)<font class="content"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"> </span></font></h2>
This description of the game applies to the<i> first edition</i>
implementation at Boardspace.&nbsp; There are several other
translations of the rules available online.&nbsp; <br>
The<i> second edition</i> adds several new components, and
a two player variant.&nbsp; The second edition rules are found <a href="WGG_Medina_Rules_GB_Web.pdf">here</a>.<br>
<br>
The game is for three or four players.&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment</span>::
Each player starts with an identical stock of playing pieces seen
below, except the first player has one extra meeple, which must be
played first.&nbsp; The unplayed pieces of each player are
concealed during the game.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Play</span>:
Each turn, each player must place 2 pieces in some legal place
according to the placement rules.&nbsp; Eventually, some pieces may
become unplayable. When only one player has playable pieces, he must
place at least one dome each turn if any are still unplayed.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Game End:</span>
When no players can play any more pieces.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Object of the
game:&nbsp; </span>Is
to score the most points, determined by the final configuration of the
board.<br>

<h2>Placement Rules</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">You should understand these
rules, but note that the interface will only allow you to place pieces
in legal spaces.&nbsp; So the simple way to play is to pick up a
piece and see where you are allowed to place it.&nbsp; Note that if
you can't pick up a piece, there are no legal places to place
it.&nbsp; This is normal for leftover palaces towards the end of
the game.&nbsp; Under unusual circumstances, you may be temporarily
unable to place a stable, but eventually able to place it.<br>

</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><img style="width: 94px; height: 80px;" alt="WALL" src="../../images/medina-wall.jpg"><br>
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Walls (and only
walls) can be placed on the edges of the board, adjacent to a tower or
to another wall.&nbsp; The walls from opposite corners grow toward
each other, but are not allowed to meet.&nbsp; There are no other
restrictions on placement of walls, and there aren't enough walls in
the game that you will ever be unable to place one.<br>

</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Meeples form a
"market" that threads among the palaces on the board.&nbsp; The
game starts with a market played in the interior of the
board.&nbsp; Subsequent meeples have to be place adjacent to
exactly one other meeple, counting horizontal and vertical connections,
ignoring diagonals.&nbsp; Effectively, this forces meeples to form
a single line, with possible expansion points at both ends.&nbsp;
If there is no legal expansion point, a new market can be started at
any unoccupied square.&nbsp;&nbsp; Effectively, there is at
most one <span style="font-style: italic;">incomplete </span>market
on the board at any time. It will always be possible to place any
meeples you have.<br>

it is not claimed by any player, and if it can still
expand.&nbsp;&nbsp; Palaces can still expand if they are not
claimed, and if there is still room to place a row of meeples between
it and any nearby palaces.&nbsp; New palaces can't be started after
all players have claimed a palace of that color, so when the last
palace of a color is claimed, the remaining palace pieces of that color
become unplayable.<br>

palace piece.&nbsp; Only the palaces you claim will increase your
score.</td>

</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><br>
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Each claimed
palace, combined with its adjacent stables, scores one point for each
palace or stable piece, plus one point for each adjacent wall tile,
plus one point for each adjacent meeple.&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on
simple geometry, each wall will score for at most one palace, each
meeple may score for one or several palaces, but each meeple will score
only once for any particular palace.</td>

</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">The four palace
tiles award bonus points for the largest palace of each
color.&nbsp; If two or more palaces are the same size, then the
first palace to attain that size scores.&nbsp; In effect, the when
you claim a larger palace, or enlarge a palace with a stable to create
a larger palace, you claim the bonus tile at that time.&nbsp;
Consequently, because of the palace bonuses, gray palaces are the least
valuable, and orange palaces the most valuable.&nbsp; The owner of
each of the palace bonus tiles may change from time to time during the
game as larger palaces are constructed.<br>

<td style="vertical-align: top;"><img style="width: 150px; height: 112px;" alt="tower" src="../../images/medina-tower-card.jpg"><br>
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">When a claimed
palace<span style="font-weight: bold;"> first</span>
makes contact with a tower via a wall, the corresponding tower bonus
tile is awarded.&nbsp; This can be due to a palace being claimed,
or to a wall tile being played adjacent to a palace, or to a stable
tile being added which connects a palace to a wall.&nbsp; The two
walls extending from each tower are contending to award the tower
bonuses.&nbsp; Each palace can claim the tower tile through each
wall only once, so palaces can't reclaim the tower by adding more
stables adjacent to the wall, or by adding more walls which are also
adjacent to the palace.&nbsp; Under unusual circumstances, one
palace can claim more than one tower, or can reclaim a tower by
touching the other wall that is connected to the tower.<br>

<h2>Strategy and Tactics<br>
</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">Obviously, the key
strategic decision is when to claim a palace.&nbsp; When is it big
enough, and positioned well enough near the other scoring resources, so
it will be worth more points to you than subsequent palaces will be
worth to other players.&nbsp; The book is completely open on
this.&nbsp;&nbsp; The board becomes crowded by mid game, with
not much room for big new palaces.&nbsp;&nbsp; Endgame tactics
center around being first to enlarge palaces to their largest size, and
last to touch the towers.<br>
