<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Rules for Plateau &#8482;<font
 class="content"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"> </span></font></h2>
The game is for two players, black and white.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment</span>:: Each player has 12
pieces (described later) which are <span style="font-style: italic;">concealed</span>
from the opponent, and a 4x4 square board.<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">object of the game </span>is to
win by either building a stack of <span style="font-style: italic;">any
</span>6 of your pieces on the board, or by capturing <span
 style="font-style: italic;">any </span>6 or your opponent's pieces.<br>
<br>
<h3>The play:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</h3>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;Black moves first, by
building a stack of two pieces and placing it on
the perimeter of the board.&nbsp;&nbsp; White can see only the top face
of the
top piece of the stack, so the colors of the other 3 faces are
initially unknown to the white player.&nbsp; White does the same.<br>
      <br>
Subsequent moves black and white alternate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moves can be
any of three types.<br>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add a new piece</span>
to the board.&nbsp; Only the top color of the new piece is initially
known to the opponent.&nbsp; The new piece can be placed on any empty
square, or on top of, or <span style="font-style: italic;">inside </span>any
stack topped by one of your own pieces.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Move a stack</span>
already on the board.&nbsp; The direction of movement is determined by
the color on top of the stack, which can be flipped over before
starting the move.&nbsp; The distance of the move is limited by the
height of the stack before the move.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can pick up and
drop off pieces along the way.&nbsp; You can <span
 style="font-style: italic;">pin</span> opponent stacks by dropping a
colored piece on them (but not a blank piece).&nbsp; You can <span
 style="font-style: italic;">capture</span> enemy pieces by dropping
your pieces on top of them at the end of your move.&nbsp;&nbsp; You
capture as many oppoent pieces as you land on top, not necessarily the
whole stack.&nbsp; If you have pinned opponent pieces , you can capture
them&nbsp; by&nbsp; "stomping" on them&nbsp; without moving.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exchange prisoners</span>.&nbsp;
You can present any subset of the pieces you have captured and request
that they be exchanged for pieces your opponent has captured.&nbsp; The
exchange rules are based on point values assigned to the pieces.&nbsp;
Important: a prisoner exchange is your entire turn - after your
opponent completes the exchange, it is
still his turn.&nbsp; The details of what can be exhanged can be hard
to determine, but it's very simple to explain.<br>
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>Your opponent is never required to give more points in
exchange than you offered, but can do so if he wishes.&nbsp; He can
decline the exchange if all possible exchances would require him to
give you more points than you offered.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Your opponent must offer the highest total he can,
without exceeding the point count offered.<br>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </ol>

<h2>The pieces:</h2>
The pieces are two-sided discs, similar to checkers, that can be
flipped over as part of normal play, and can be a different
color.&nbsp; The uncertainty about the color of unseen faces of the
pieces is a major component of the game.<br>

chess knights when their orange face is on top, or like mutes when

<h3>Revealing hidden information:</h3>
Initially, both sides of the bottom piece from your first move, and the
bottom&nbsp; side of every piece placed on the board is hidden from
your opponent.&nbsp; This hidden information is gradually revealed in
the course of the game, as you flip pieces over, capture pieces, remove
pieces that were stacked on top, or capture pieces that were on
top.&nbsp; Conceptually, what is revealed is governed by the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">one hand rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You can
manipulate pieces only by using one hand, and as if you were very
clumsy and incapable of any fancy sleight-of-hand.&nbsp; <br>
In particular:<br>
<ul>
  <li>If you flip a piece over, the top of the piece under it becomes
visible.</li>
  <li>If you insert a piece into the middle of a stack, the top of the
piece you rest on becomes visible.</li>
  <li>If you capture a piece, the top of the piece it was resting on
becomes visible.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
*****************************<br>
General<br>
<br>
If a player has no legal moves, then his turn is forfeited.&nbsp; A
draw can be called by mutual agreement of the players.<br>
