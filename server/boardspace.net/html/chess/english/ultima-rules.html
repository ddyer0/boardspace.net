This page is based on the guide from Chessvariants.com <a href="http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/ultima.html">Ultima</a>
pieces capture. The diagrams use special graphics to represent the
Ultima pieces, although typically, ortho-chess pieces are used to
reperesent them.
<p>For more information on Ultima, see their <a href="http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/ultima.html">Ultima
web page</a>.
</p>
<p>Note that the King does not appear in the following table.
That's because the King in Ultima moves and captures just like the King
in orth-chess, except for castling -- there is no castling in Ultima.
</p>
<p>None of the pieces in Ultima (except the King) capture by
displacement. The one exception to this is the Chameleon which can
threaten a King via a displacement capture.

The White Coordinator captures the Black Pinching Pawn at a4
</td>
<td valign="top">
<h2><img src="./ultima-rules_files/coordinator.gif" height="46" width="46"> The Coordinator</h2>
The Coordinator moves like an ortho-chess Queen, but captures in a
special way: it captures by 'coordinating' with the King.
When a Coordinator moves, any enemy piece that is on the same
rank (or row) as the Coordinator, <i>and</i> the same file
(or
column) as the King, is captured. And vice-versa, any enemy piece that
is on the same file as the King, and on the same rank as the
Coordinator, is also captured.
<p>The Coordinator never captures when another piece moves.
It only captures on its <i>own</i> move.

The Black Long Leaper captures both White Pinching Pawns by leaping
over them
</td>
<td valign="top">
<h2><img src="./ultima-rules_files/longleaper.gif" height="46" width="46"> The Long Leaper</h2>
The Long Leaper moves like an ortho-chess Queen, but captures in a
special way:
it captures by leaping over an enemy piece.
The enemy piece must have a vacant square directly behind it
(behind relative to the location of the Long Leaper). The Long
Leaper jumps over the enemy piece and lands in any of the
vacant squares behind it. The Long Leaper cannot jump over
friendly pieces, but it may make multiple leaps in a single
direction.
<p>The Long Leaper leaps in a straight line in any of the
eight
directions.
</p>
<p>In the diagram to the left, the White Long Leaper could
make any
of the following moves:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a1-a3 (xa2)
</li>
<li>a1-a4 (xa2)
</li>
<li>a1-a6 (xa2) (xa5)
</li>
<li>a1-a7 (xa2) (xa5)
</li>
<li>a1-a8 (xa2) (xa5)
</li>

The Black Withdrawer on b3 captures the White Pinching Pawn on b4 by
moving away from it
</td>
<td valign="top">
<h2><img src="./ultima-rules_files/withdrawer.gif" height="46" width="46"> The Withdrawer</h2>
The Withdrawer moves like an ortho-chess Queen, but captures in a
special way:
it captures by moving directly away from an enemy piece.
It must start its move adjacent to the enemy piece, and move one or
more squares in a straight line directly <i>away</i> from
that piece.
The piece moved away from is then captured.

Black Immobilizer paralyzes the White Chameleon, Pinching Pawn, Long
Leaper, and King
</td>
<td valign="top">
<h2><img src="./ultima-rules_files/immobilizer.gif" height="46" width="46"> The Immobilizer</h2>
The Immobilizer moves like an ortho-chess Queen, but is unable to
capture.
Instead, the Immobilizer paralyzes any adjacent
enemy pieces, causing them to be immobile. The Immobilizer does
not paralyze friendly pieces, nor does it paralyze non-adjacent pieces
that move past or over it. Pieces that can never capture an Immobilizer
are: Kings, Immobilizers,
Chameleons, and Withdrawers. Pieces become unparalyzed when the
Immobilizer paralyzing them moves away or is captured.
<p>In the diagram to the left, the White Chameleon is
paralyzed by the Black Immobilizer, and
in return, the Black Immobilizer is paralyzed by the White Chameleon.
On White's next move,
the Long Leaper (at d3) can capture the Black Immobilizer by leaping to
a3.
</p>
<p>Any piece that is paralyzed by an Immobilizer, is
allowed to capture itself
(ie. commit suicide). This counts as the player's move.

The White Pinching Pawn on b1 captures the Black Withdrawer on b4 by
pinching it between itself and the White King
</td>
<td valign="top">
<h2><img src="./ultima-rules_files/pinchpawn.gif" height="46" width="46"> The Pinching Pawn</h2>
The Pinching Pawn moves like an ortho-chess Rook, but captures in a
special way:
it captures by pinning an enemy piece between itself and another
friendly piece. So when a White Pinching Pawn moves to a square, if
there is a
Black piece directly to the east of it, with a White piece directly to
the east of the Black piece, then then Black piece is captured. The
same holds
true for pieces to the west, north, and south of the destination
square.
<p>Pinching Pawns only capture when they make a move. They
never capture passively.
So a piece moving directly <i>between</i> two Pinching
Pawns is <i>not</i> captured.

<h2><img src="./ultima-rules_files/chameleon.gif" height="46" width="46"> The Chameleon</h2>
The Chameleon moves like an ortho-chess Queen, but captures in a
special way:
it captures an enemy piece using the <i>enemy piece's</i>
method of capturing. The diagram to the left is an illustration
of the Chameleon capturing seven pieces in one move.
<ul>
<li>It captures the enemy Withdrawer (at c1) by moving
away from it.
</li>
<li>It captures the two enemy Long Leapers by leaping
over them.
</li>
<li>It captures the three enemy Pinching Pawns by
pinching them.
</li>
<li>It captures the enemy Coordinator by coordinating
with the King.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the Chameleon can only capture Pinching Pawns
by moving
like a Rook. Chameleons can never capture enemy Chameleons, but they
can paralyze an enemy Immobilizer by moving adjacent to it (of course,
in that case, the Chameleon itself is also paralyzed).
</p>
<p>In the diagram to the left, the White Chameleon also
gives check to
the Black King.
