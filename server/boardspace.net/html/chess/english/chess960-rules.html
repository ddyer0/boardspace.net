</table><br>The main thing is that except for the setup, Chess960 is
just chess. &nbsp;The difference is that the major pieces are
positioned <span style="font-style: italic;">mostly</span> randomly, but with two constraints.<br><ul><li>The king is always positioned between the two rooks.</li><li>The bishops are always placed on opposite colors.</li></ul>By
some method of counting, there are 960 possible opening positions.
&nbsp;Hence the name. &nbsp;Consequently, there is no opening book; but
all the chess principles you know<br>from standard chess still apply.
&nbsp;Check/Checkmate, forks, pins, mobility, doubled pawns; everything
you know or ought to know about chess still applies - except you<br>can't memorize openings.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Castling: </span>Is simple; the "kings side" and "queen's side" castling moves <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">end </span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span>with the king and rook in the same positions as in standard chess, regardless of their <br>starting positions. &nbsp;On Boardspace, you indicate castling by moving as though the king were going to capture the rook.<br><br>
