<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Rules for Tumbleweed</h2><br><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Game_description">Game description</span></h2>
<p>Tumbleweed is a two-player game. It is played on a hexhex board and a sufficient supply of stacked checkers.
</p><p>A stack can "see" a hex, when they are connected by a straight 
line, with no stacks in between. The players take turns placing stacks 
of their tokens on hexes that are seen by at least one friendly stack. 
The height of every newly-placed stack equals the number of your stacks 
that see the new stack. Replacing an existing stack with a new stack is 
possible, as long as the new stack is taller than the previous one. This
 works with opponent stacks (to capture), or your own stacks (to 
reinforce).
</p><p>Before the game, the host sets up the board and the guest decides
 which side they want to play. Setup consists of one stack of two 
neutral tokens in the central hex, and a single starting token for each 
player in hexes of the host's choosing.
</p><p>The game ends when no more moves can be made by either player, or
 after two successive passes. The player who occupies or controls over half the 
board wins.</p><p></p><p></p><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Initial_setup">Initial setup</span></h3>
