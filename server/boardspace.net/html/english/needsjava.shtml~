<h1 style="text-align: center;">BoardSpace needs Java!</h1>
Although Java applets are extinct, &nbsp;Java applications are
alive and well, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Java
Web Start </span>is the standard technology to launch java
applications from browsers. &nbsp;You still need to install java,
and grant permission for java web start to download and run the
boardspace application. &nbsp;Also note, that if you prefer to use
a tablet instead of &nbsp;a PC, this page is irrelevant to you.
&nbsp;You should go to the app store and download the
boardspace.net app.<br>
<br>
Java is pre-installed on many computers, in which case you don't
need to do anything. &nbsp;If not installed yet, go to <a href="https://java.com/">Java.com</a> and install it,
or <br>
if you're not sure the status of java on your computer, Java.com also
has a&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.xml">Troubleshooting
page</a>&nbsp; .<br>
using <a href="%3C%21--#include%20virtual=%22/cgi-bin/applettag.cgi?tagname=jwsrawlink%22%20--%3E">
<img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 80px; height: 43px;" alt="java web start icon" title="click to launch boardspace with java web start" src="/images/java-web-star-icon.jpg">
</a>
When you click on the  link from your browser, you should
see a window like this:<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img style="width: 433px; height: 332px;" alt="java web start open" src="../images/java-web-start-open.jpg"></td>
<td>Or depending on how your browser is configured to
handle downloads, something less obvious,<br>
for example Chrome pops&nbsp;up this notice at the bottom-left of the current
window.<br>
<img style="width: 531px; height: 77px;" alt="chrome download" src="../images/chrome-download.jpg"><br>
<br>
Or you might see nothing at all, and you need to look at the browser's
downloads, however<br>
is appropriate for your browser.<br>
<img style="width: 457px; height: 166px;" alt="browser download" src="../images/browser-download.jpg">
<br>Click right on the downloaded file, select "open with" and choose java web start launcher.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br><h2>If java web start doesn't start anything</h2><br><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><img style="width: 684px; height: 524px;" alt="open with menu" src="../images/openwith.jpg"></td><td>Getting java web start to run depends on a file name association
between ".jnlp" files and java web start. &nbsp;It's possible for this
association to be broken, in which case instead of launching java
web start, the .jnlp file will be downloaded and opened with some other
program,typically a text editor. &nbsp; <br><br>In
this case, you need to
re-establish the linkage. &nbsp; First locatate the downloaded file,
probably in your downloads directory. &nbsp;Click right and select
"open with". &nbsp;Look for "Java web start" in the choice list. &nbsp;
If it's not there, select "choose another app" and &nbsp;navigate to
"javaws" in the programs directory.<br><img style="width: 828px; height: 168px;" alt="javaws" src="../images/javaws.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>
The main theme is you need to download the small ".jnlp" file, then
launch it using java web start. &nbsp;That will normally lead to a
security warning<br>
like this: &nbsp;Hint; you have to approve of the application
running.<br>
<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img style="width: 517px; height: 289px;" alt="java web start security" src="../images/jws-security.jpg"><br>
If you check the "do not show this again" box, you won't see it again.</td>
<td>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3>A word about security and trust</h3>
</div>
Any time you run any program on your computer, <span style="font-weight: bold;">you
have to trust the party that supplied the program</span>.
Programs can potentially
steal, delete, or mess up all your data, hijack your machine, and
otherwise make your online life a mess. &nbsp;There's nothing
special about Java programs. &nbsp;There's nothing new about this.
&nbsp;Any cute game, or useful utility, or essential business
program you've ever installed should have same warning attached, including
the browser you're running right now. &nbsp;On PCs, security was
tacked on and is very imperfect.<br>
<br>
So don't panic. <br>
<br>
The situation on tablets and phones is a little better, because
individual programs run in a more strictly controlled environment.</td>

<br>
<br>
<br>
After the security prompt, and some splash screens, you should <span style="font-style: italic;">finally</span> get to a
screen like this, which is the actual application running:<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 490px; height: 246px;" alt="java web start login screen" src="../images/java-web-start-login.jpg"><br>
</div>
If
you do see this, you're in good shape, the application is running and
has successfully contacted the site. &nbsp;You can go ahead and<br>
log in as a guest, or register an account and log in as yourself.<br>
<br>
After you log in, you should see a screen that looks something like
this:<br>
<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">
<h3>Good</h3>
</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">
<h3>Not Good</h3>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img style="width: 506px; height: 483px;" alt="normal lobby" src="../images/normal-lobby.jpg"><br>
Good! &nbsp;You're logged in and ready to play.</td>
<td>There are two not-good alternatives. &nbsp;One is
that you see a message box like this:<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 381px; height: 119px;" alt="server not running" src="../images/server-not-running.jpg"><br>
</div>
This message is from the site, and probably is accurate. &nbsp;<br>
Don't panic, It doesn't happen very often.<br>
<br>
The other bad outcome is to see a lobby window like the one at the left,<br>
but it remains gray and dead, and eventuall displays a "server down"<br>
message like this:<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 504px; height: 309px;" alt="lobby down" src="../images/normal-lobby-down.jpg"><br>
</div>
In this case, most likely the server is fine, but there is a networking
problem somewhere between your machine and the server. &nbsp;See
the section on <a href="#firewalls"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Firewalls</span> </a>below.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<h1><a name="firewalls"></a>Firewalls,
Routers, Ports and Proxies, Lost Connections<br>
</h1>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If you get some kind of
"can't connect" message in the lobby chat area</span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Java&nbsp;must
be able to open an outgoing tcp connection on <span style="font-weight: bold;">port 2255.&nbsp; </span>Most
firewalls and routers are configured allow this; but some institutions
(work, school) and some personal firewall products (blackice, zone
alarm) may block this port.&nbsp; If the lobby window comes up, but
can't connect to the server, look for problems with port
2255.&nbsp; The lobby will also fail to connect if it was loaded
from some place other than Boardspace.net, which could be a side effect
of some browser proxy setups.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.boardspace.net:4321/"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a>If you get
the message<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><font style="font-weight: bold;" face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">rcv 221 errConnection error</font> then you
have successfully connected to the server, but your connection has been
rejected.&nbsp; The most likely cause of this is that you
accidentally connected to the server without going through the login
procedure, or the login process took a really long time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If you lose connection in
mid-game: </span>don't panic, you can reconnect and rejoin the
game. &nbsp;Normally this is completely automatic, but if you are
forced to start over and log in again, you can resume a game that was
in process. This can happen for a variety of reasons, most of which are
impossible to predict or control.&nbsp; Watch the little
spinner&nbsp;<img alt="clock spinner" src="../images/spinner.jpg" style="width: 65px; height: 17px;">
located next to your clock (and your opponents clock).&nbsp; The
little arrow should change position at least every 10 seconds or so,
and if it has not changed position recently, the color starts fading
from green to red.&nbsp; After 2 minutes of no activity a timeout
will occur and you can try to reconnect. <br>
<br>
<b>Slow&nbsp; connections: </b>Once the application is
downloaded, the bandwidth required to maintain the lobby and a game is
very modest, and any type of internet connection should work
fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; One problem we have seen a few times is that
firewalls such as Zone Alarm interfere with the flow of data to the
server without completely blocking it. We don't know why, but disabling
Zone Alarm fixes the problem.&nbsp; A test for this condition is to
switch the type of a game room, say from "Game Room" to "Unranked
Room".&nbsp; The changeover should happen very fast, within a
second.&nbsp; If there is more that a very brief lag, look for this
kind of networking problem.<br>
<br>
<h1>On Windows</h1>
On windows machines, if java is installed there ought to be a java
control panel. &nbsp;If java web start seems to be non-starting,<br>
that's the place to look. &nbsp;Information about java web start
programs is found under "temporary internet files". &nbsp;<br>
<img style="width: 1224px; height: 367px;" alt="java control panel" src="../images/java-control-panel.jpg"><br>
<br>
<h1>On Macintosh</h1>
Macs have a security setting that prevents "downloaded programs" from
running, which you have to turn off to install the boardspace<br>
application. <br>
