    </p>
    <h2>Executive summary:</h2>
    <p>Over
time, as the game space evolved and the requirements for game screen
layouts became more complex, the basic construction of &nbsp;layouts
has changed several times.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>The Problem Space: </h2>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">&nbsp;It's
alll about rectangles, man. &nbsp;The game window is a rectangle, the
board is a rectangle, most of the other items in a game window are
naturally rectangles. &nbsp; From there, the problem gets a lot more
complicated. &nbsp; Some rectangles have to be a certain size, or
should be placed near other items. &nbsp;Some are optional. &nbsp;Some
are fixed size, or have a minimum size, or can reasonably expand to
fill the space available.

    <h2>In the beginning: </h2>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">In
the beginning I had a basic template for all (about 3 ...) games.
&nbsp; The window was rectangular, with a chat window on top, a board
in the lower left, game specific information to the right, &nbsp;and
maybe some additional information below the board.<br><br>To scale and
locate all the elements, I used the board grid as a sort of unit for
allocation. &nbsp;And lay out the other items by size and location
based on the cell size of the board. &nbsp; Plateau seen at the left,
would need a 4x4 grid for the board, or 5x5 with borders all the way
around. &nbsp; The chat should be about 10 cells (twice as wide as the
board) and the game log 3 cells wide. &nbsp; Player stuff about 5 cells
wide and 3 cells high (per player) ... and so on. &nbsp;Add up all the
vertical and horizontal cell counts, do some simple arithmetic, and
come up with a pixel count for &nbsp;a cell. &nbsp;Then lay out the
rectangles accordingly.<br><br>This worked pretty well at first. &nbsp;The scheme produced reasably full screens with relatively little wasted space.<br><br><br>

    <br><h2>Wide and Tall boards (3 basic layouts instead of 1)</h2><br><br><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><br>Next,
it became obvious that sometimes people preferred (or were constrained)
to use very wide or very tall window shapes. &nbsp;The basic plan,
above, didn't produce good results. &nbsp;The basic board plan evolved
to include "wide mode" and "tall mode" windows. &nbsp; Wide mode
windows (seen below) had the board occupying essentially all the
vertical space, with player information adjacent, and the chat window
filling space at the right. &nbsp; Tall mode windows (seen at the
right) had the board occupy substantially all horizontal space, with
the &nbsp;chat above and the player information below the board. &nbsp;
<br>Initially, the choice of wide/normal/tall was ad-hoc based on the
aspect ratio of the window, but the overall method was the same.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="2"><img style="width: 582px; height: 796px;" alt="tall board" src="tall%20board.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td><img style="width: 1239px; height: 589px;" alt="wide baord" src="wide%20board.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>No Chat boards (6 basic designs per game)</h2><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><br>Some
very small screens just don't have room for a chat area, so it's moved
to a separate window. &nbsp;In a lot of games, the chat is pretty
surpufluous - no one chats with a robot. &nbsp;So removing the chat can
free up a lot of real estate, but the business of deciding where all
the boxes are going to go is getting pretty complex. &nbsp; The
algorithm is the same - place the boxes relative to one another, add up
the number of cells needed, do arithmetic to determine the cell size.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 889px; height: 687px;" alt="normal no chat" src="normal%20no%20chat%20board.jpg"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="2"><img style="width: 569px; height: 696px;" alt="tall no chat" src="tall%20no%20chat%20board.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td><img style="width: 1461px; height: 686px;" alt="wide no chat" src="wide%20no%20chat%20board.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
