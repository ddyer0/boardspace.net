    <h2>Executive summary:</h2>
    <p>Over
time, as the game space evolved and the requirements for game screen
layouts became more complex, the basic construction of &nbsp;layouts
has changed several times.<br>

          <td colspan="2" valign="top"><h2 style="text-align: center;">The Problem Space:</h2>It's
alll about rectangles. &nbsp;The game window is a rectangle, the
board is a rectangle, most of the other items in a game window are
naturally rectangles. &nbsp;From there, the problem gets a lot more
complicated. &nbsp; Some rectangles have to be a certain size, or
should be placed near other items. &nbsp;Some are optional. &nbsp;Some
are fixed size, or have a minimum size, or can reasonably expand to
fill the space available.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;

        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><h2 style="text-align: center;">In the beginning:</h2>In
the beginning I had a basic template for all (about 3 at the time) games.
&nbsp; The window was rectangular, with a chat window on top, <br>a board
in the lower left, game specific information to the right, &nbsp;and
maybe some additional information below the board.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 679px; height: 516px;" alt="simple board" src="basic%20board.jpg"><br></div>To scale and
locate all the elements, I used the board grid as a sort of unit for
allocation. &nbsp;And lay out the other items by size and<br>location
based on the cell size of the board. &nbsp; Plateau seen at the left,
would need a 4x4 grid for the board, or 5x5 with borders all<br>the way
around. &nbsp; The chat should be about 10 cells (twice as wide as the
board) and the game log 3 cells wide. &nbsp; Player stuff about<br>5 cells
wide and 3 cells high (per player) ... and so on. &nbsp;Add up all the
vertical and horizontal cell counts, do some simple arithmetic,<br>and
come up with a pixel count for &nbsp;a cell. &nbsp;Then lay out the
rectangles accordingly.<br><br>This worked pretty well at first. &nbsp;The scheme produced reasably full screens with relatively little wasted space.<br><br>

it became obvious that sometimes people preferred (or were constrained)
to use very wide or very tall window shapes. &nbsp;The basic plan,
above, didn't produce good results. &nbsp;The basic board plan evolved
to include "wide mode" and "tall mode" windows. &nbsp; Wide mode
windows (seen below) had the board occupying essentially all the
vertical space, with player information adjacent, and the chat window
filling space at the right. &nbsp; Tall mode windows (seen below) had the board occupy substantially all horizontal space, with
the chat above and the player information below the board. &nbsp;
Initially, the choice of wide/normal/tall was ad-hoc based on the
aspect ratio of the window, but the overall method was the same.<br><br>&nbsp;<img style="width: 350px; height: 479px;" alt="tall board" src="tall%20board.jpg" align="top"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img style="width: 617px; height: 375px;" alt="wide baord" src="wide%20board.jpg"><br></td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table style="text-align: left; width: 1058px; height: 1090px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><h2 style="text-align: center;">No Chat boards (6 basic designs per game)</h2><div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 80px;">Some
very small screens just don't have room for a chat area, so it's moved
to a separate window. &nbsp;In a lot of games, <br>particularly games played against robots, the chat is pretty
surpufluous - no one chats with a robot. &nbsp;So removing the<br>chat can
free up a lot of real estate, but the business of deciding where all
the boxes are going to go is becoming complex<br><br>The
algorithm is the same - place the boxes relative to one another, add up
the number of cells needed, do arithmetic to <br>determine the cell size.<br></div><img style="width: 415px; height: 508px;" alt="tall no chat" src="tall%20no%20chat%20board.jpg"> &nbsp; &nbsp;<img style="width: 579px; height: 447px;" alt="normal no chat" src="normal%20no%20chat%20board.jpg"><br><br><img style="width: 820px; height: 385px;" alt="wide no chat" src="wide%20no%20chat%20board.jpg"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><table style="text-align: left; width: 777px; height: 1009px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><h2 style="text-align: center;">Multiple Players</h2>Accomodating
games with up to 6 players introduced complication. &nbsp;A game with 6
players&nbsp; has very different space requirements than the same game
with only 2 players; and depending on the amount of per-player
information, the best layout can vary a lot. &nbsp;Think: 1-3 columns
right of the board. &nbsp;1-3 columns or below the board.<br><br><img style="width: 696px; height: 329px;" alt="six right" src="six-right.jpg"><br><br><img style="width: 698px; height: 521px;" alt="six below" src="six-below.jpg"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
