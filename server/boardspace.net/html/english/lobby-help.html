<h1 style="text-align: center;">Guide to Lobby Features</h1>The next
window after you log in is the Lobby, which is where you find other
players and set up games to be played. &nbsp;The three main areas<br>are
a chat area, a list of other players, and a list of rooms where games
can be configured. &nbsp;The general procedure is to locate a room <br>and join it, or reconfigure an empty room and join it. &nbsp; 
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 1200px; height: 933px;" alt="normal lobby" src="../images/lobby-guide.jpg"><br><div style="text-align: left;">The
&nbsp;lobby shows who is logged in, and allows you to play or spectate
in games. &nbsp;It may not be obvious, but most of the features in the
lobby<br>are clickable. &nbsp; The basic flow is that you either join a
room where someone else has set up a game, or select an empty room,
configure it,<br>and start your own game.<br><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Select the type of game you want to play</span></td><td>If
you are looking for a particular game, click here and select a game.
&nbsp;This will advertise to everyone else in the lobby which game you
want to play, but it doesn't directly do anything else.</td></tr><tr><td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Send to all, or a single player</span></td><td>Chat messages can be sent to everyone in the lobby, or privately to a single player you select here.</td></tr><tr><td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Send a line of chat</span></td><td>Send a line of chat to the players in the lobby.</td></tr><tr><td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set the room type</span></td><td>There are several room types, the most important are <br><ul><li>Play Games - rooms where you can actually play a game</li><li>Unranked Games - rooms where you can play games that do not affect your rankings.</li><li>Review Games - rooms where you can replay games from the archives.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Click to Start a game</span></td><td>When enough players are waiting to start a game, click here to actually launch the game. &nbsp;Only the<br>person who set up the game, and "owns the room" can start the game.<br>For games "in progress", this button will say "spectate", you can click to watch the game being played.</td></tr><tr><td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Click to take a seat</span></td><td>Click on an empty seat to wait for the game to start. &nbsp;In games with human opponents, this also <br>selects the starting player or color you will play. &nbsp;In games with robot opponents, the starting player<br>is randomized.</td></tr><tr><td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Game being played or planned</span></td><td>The middle column show what games are in progress. &nbsp;You can click to scroll the games list to see the room.</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></div>T<br>

<h3>Other Lobby Procedures</h3>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>You can close the lobby without affecting games in
progress, but you must keep the original browser window open and
pointing to the original login page.</li>
<li>Ranked robot games are stored in the server, so you can
abandon them any time and get back to them later.&nbsp; In that
case the button which normally says "play robot" will say "rejoin
robot".<br>
</li>
<li>You can <span style="font-weight: bold;">rejoin
games</span> against human players if you crash out, as long as
either the other player or one of the spectators did not
crash.</li><li>You can <span style="font-weight: bold;">resume games </span>which
were interrupted by all the players leaving, accidentally or otherwise.
&nbsp;Simply set up a new game of the same type, with the same players,
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Resume </span>will replace <span style="font-style: italic;">Start</span><br>
</li>
</ul>
