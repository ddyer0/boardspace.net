When participating in tournaments or turn based games, boardspace will
send messages relevant to events. &nbsp;We all know that emails are
unreliable - they get lost in the clutter, filtered into spam boxes,
blocked by providers and so on. &nbsp; The notifications address in
your profile is to help you to not miss events relevant to the games
you're paricipating in. &nbsp; The "notifications" address in your user<br>profile can be one of three things:<br><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Blank</span>. &nbsp;In that case, your registered email address is used to send notifications</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">An email address</span>. &nbsp;In that case this address is used instead of your regular email address for notifications.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">A discord UID. </span>In
that case the message log on the boardspace discord server will also
generate an @mention which you can cause to generate an immediate
notification.</li><li>A uid from <a href="https://Alertzy.app/">Alertzy</a>.</li></ol><br><h2>About discord.</h2><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> is a free service that
provides interactive text,&nbsp; images, audio and video. &nbsp;It's
good for real time chats, and not bad for blog-like chatter. &nbsp;It's
widely used in the game community.<br>Apps are available for all the
common platforms, and they all share the same content. &nbsp;Boardspace
encourages everyone to set up a discord account, install the apps on
your devices.<br><br>Boardspace has a discord server which you should join. &nbsp;Here's the <a href="https://discord.gg/BZP7fgk">invite</a>.<br><br>I recommend using discord<br><ul><li>as an alternative to Zoom to accompany real time games among friends. &nbsp;</li><li>to meet, greet and monitor opponents in tournament games. &nbsp;</li><li>for general chatter about the site or playing on it.</li></ul>One
of the channels on the boardspace discord server is the
"tournament-notifications" channel., which logs activity in boardspace
tournaments. &nbsp;It's probably too noisy to watch all the time, but
if you jump through a few hoops, it's possible to get a realtime
notification on all your discord apps whenever a tournament e-mail is
sent to you. &nbsp;The hoops are:<br><ul><li>find your discord user id (it's an 18 digit number). &nbsp;It's currently difficult to find on discord but here are <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/how-to-find-discord-id/">the instructions</a>.</li><li><a href="/cgi-bin/edit.cgi">edit your boardspace profile</a> and add the ID to it.</li><li>in the boardspace tournament-notifications channel, set the notification-settings to @mentions only</li></ul><h2><a name="alertz"></a>About Alertzy</h2>Alertzy
is a standalone app (ios or android) whose sole purpose is to receive
notifications. &nbsp; It's free at the scale you're likely<br>to need
for game or tournament notifications. &nbsp;Simply install the app on your favorite
mobile, and use the UID for boardspace notifications.
 <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Email Tricks</h2>Depending on how complex your email habits are, you could an email address for notifications which could be<br>different
from your usual flow, and more likely to catch your attention. &nbsp;For
example, if you use a protonmail.com email address<br>for this (and not much else) then the protonmail &nbsp;apps' "you have mail" notifications will be sepatate.<br><br>Another possibility is to turn emails directly&nbsp;into notifications, similar to <a href="alertz">Alertz</a>.. &nbsp;To do this, install the apps (or browser extensions) <br>from<a href="https://pushover.net/"> pushover.net. </a>or<a href="https://www.pushsafer.com/"> pushsafer.com </a>&nbsp;These apps
exist solely to receive notifications that you send them. &nbsp;Then,
use the email address <br>they provide as the notification address.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;</span>These services aren't quite free, but they're very inexpensive.<br><br>
