    <h1 align="center">Porting Boardspace.net using Codenameone</h1>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Executive summary:</h2>
    <p>In two months of intense work, I ported a large java program to
      IOS and Android using codenameone, and maintained a shared code
      base with the starting version.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were many speed
      bumps along the way, but the successful result did not entail any
      substantial rewrites or major bodies of new code.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      After the initial effort to get it working, I ported a second
      (related) large program in about a month, spent another 4 months
      tuning, completing features, and adding touch screen friendly
      behaviors to both programs.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>The Problem Space: </h2>
    Boardspace.net uses a java client to allow users to play real time
    board games over the internet.&nbsp; The core code that runs all of
    the games is packaged in a small number of jar files, about a
    megabyte in all, built from 160 source files containing 50,000 lines
    of Java. &nbsp; &nbsp; The bulk of the porting effort is to retain
    the functionality of this core, so that about 75 individual games,
    consisting of a further 800 source files and 300,000 lines of Java
    could be used essentially unchanged.&nbsp; The total amount of
    compiled code in the system (with 75 games) is about 4MB, plus a lot
    of graphics. &nbsp; As a porting problem there are several strong
    constraints.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The biggest problem is the sheer size of the code.&nbsp; Any
        porting approach that would require a substantial rewrite is a
        non-starter.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>Reliable TCP streams are required.&nbsp; Http transactions are
        also used.</li>
      <li>There is heavy use of custom graphics, constructed and scaled
        on the fly.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the other side, non-constraints include:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Swing, fancy UI widgets, or third party libraries, are not
        required.&nbsp; Standard Java APIs from the AWT era are all that
        are needed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The games UIs are already laid out deceptively for varying
        screen size and geometry,&nbsp; and the UI is already known to
        work with single-finger touch interfaces.&nbsp; The physical
        parameters of tablets won't be a problem, except the physically
        small size on some devices.</li>
      <li>There is no requirement to use platform specific capability
        (such as GPS) or services (such as embedding Ads).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    In view of the above, codenameone looked pretty attractive; TCP
    sockets are supported,&nbsp; the user interface API is similar to
    AWT, and it promised to provide IOS and Android ports without major
    rewrites or paradigm shifts.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <h2>The Plan: </h2>
    My overall plan was to build the codenameone version so it shared
    all except the list of imports at the top of each file with the
    current code, so that in the future, the codename1 and standard java
    branches would be substantially identical.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>core Java classes would have to be used "as is". Examples are
        Image,&nbsp; Graphics, Font.&nbsp; These are pervasive in all
        the UI code, and trying to replace or substantially alter them
        is not a good plan.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Where codenameone functionality is missing, or substantially
        different from standard Java, create adapter classes to either
        provide the missing functionality or bridge between what
        codenameone provides and standard Java.&nbsp; Examples:
        Color,&nbsp; Component (the base class for all windows), and
        Event.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Where adapting or using as-is is not possible, drop into
        platform-specific code which implements a new API that is
        neither java or codename1, but which does what is needed.&nbsp;
        Examples; Rectangles and Font selection.&nbsp; Here, it is
        necessary, edit the code to use the new API, but once edited it
        will be the same in all branches.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Initially, set aside all but one game.&nbsp; All of the games
        are substantially similar, and should be used pretty much as-is
        if the core files are ported according to plan.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>First get the whole body of the codename1 branch through the
        compiler.&nbsp; Then get it working.&nbsp; Then back port the
        codename1 version to standard java and get <i>that </i>working,

        iterate until both versions are working and substantially
        identical (except for "import" lines at the top of each
        file).&nbsp; Isolate irreconcilable differences in a few files
        that are not intended to be identical.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Phase 1: getting through the compiler</h2>
    <p><br>
      Starting with a duplicate branch of my source hierarchy as a
      codenameone project, one file at a time, eliminate compiler
      errors.&nbsp; This is a tedious and difficult process, because
      nothing works yet, nothing can be tested, and every error requires
      a treasure hunt and an educated guess how best to resolve
      it.&nbsp;&nbsp; These guesses were frequently wrong, creating a
      backtrack, undo and re-edit cycle.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Core classes such as Image, Font, and Graphics and String,
        which are provided by the environment and which are mostly
        created by the system rather than by calling "new", are not
        going to be subclassed.&nbsp; Mismatches in the APIs are handled
        by adding new static methods to the "garbage" class G which will
        be differently implemented in codenameone and standard
        java.&nbsp;&nbsp; This localizes all the knowledge about
        differences in class G. &nbsp; Example: standard java operations
        on images typically require an ImageObserver as one of the
        arguments, where otherwise similar codenameone methods do not,
        so define G.getWidth(image,imageObserver) where the codenameone
        implementation will ignore the ImageObserver.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Other common classes, such as windows and widgets, have to be
        subclassed or encapsulated, and any missing methods provided in
        the subclass.&nbsp; Initially these are dummy methods that will
        throw an error if called.&nbsp; This strategy accumulated about
        100 "bridge" classes that cover the differences between
        codenameone and standard java functionality.&nbsp; Examples:
        bridge.Container extends com.codename1.UI.Container,&nbsp;
        bridge.Date encapsulates java.util.date.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever
        the shared functionality is missing or probably not identical,
        create a new "not implemented" method in the bridge class to be
        fixed later.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Lots of little pieces of functionality from standard java are
        just not there, or are in different places.&nbsp; Examples:
        standard java Math.pow is implemented by MathUtil.pow;
        Integer.bitCount is missing from Codename1.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The two most difficult cases in this process proved to be <b>
        Rectangle </b>and <b>Event</b>.&nbsp; Don't take these as
      condemnation, only as illustration of the kind of issue you can
      expect to have to contend with.<br>
    </p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
            <p>The class <b>Rectangle </b>proved to be one of those
              awful birthmarks that can never be erased.&nbsp; <br>
            </p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard Java defines<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public integer x ;<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; public double getX()</p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Codenameone defines<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public int getX()<br>
            </p>
            <p>there is absolutely no way these can be reconciled.&nbsp;
              Rectangles are so common in the UI, it's just not
              practical to replace them with an encapsulating class, and
              switching uniformly to the accessor function getX()&nbsp;
              will cause all manner of calculations to switch to
              floating point in standard java, causing compatibility
              nightmares.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately rectangles are
              ubiquitous, and in the overall code base, thousands of
              instances of rectangle manipulation had to be manually
              edited.&nbsp; Since my goal was to have one source, I
              created functions like&nbsp; "public static int
              Width(Rectangle r)" with different implementations for
              Codename1 and standard java.<br>
            </p>
          </td>
          <td valign="top"> The class <b>Event</b>, and all its
            subclasses, is another nasty case.&nbsp; The concept they
            implement is the same, but the details of the event types
            and handlers differ wildly.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            I ended up creating a shadow hierarchy of common window
            types, "bridge.Container extends com.codename1.UI.Container"
            and so on.&nbsp; The bridge classes implement the standard
            java "addxxListener" methods, and handle them using a&nbsp;
            "MouseAdapter" class.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            MouseAdapter receives codename1 events, transforms them, and
            dispatches them to standard java event handlers.&nbsp; The
            messiest part of this is that I couldn't simply implement
            bridge.Component and let the rest of the window hierarchy
            inherit from it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, all of the window
            types I use from standard java have quirks that are not
            implemented in the corresponding Codename1 classes, so I
            needed a bridge.xx class for every window type I use.<br>

    <h2>Phase 2: getting the Codename1 (Android) version working.<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Since this was a large body of legacy code, there were few unit
      tests or test beds in place; but Once the whole project compiles,
      it's simple to insert scaffolding to test various pieces. I had
      flagged a few key pieces as critical, likely to be troublesome,
      and separable from the overall application. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The first of these is networking.&nbsp; The framework requires
      HTTP connections to negotiate login, collect information from the
      server site, and report problems back to be logged.&nbsp; The
      games themselves require a persistent TCP stream to be opened, and
      a continuous (but not high bandwidth) chitchat with the server to
      be reliable.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>HTTP connections, using a low level interface, turned out to work
      perfectly.<br>
    </p>
    <p>TCP sockets immediately proved to be unreliable.&nbsp;&nbsp; My
      framework was already paranoid about the reliability of the
      streams, so the problems showed up immediately, rather than
      percolating into the operational code.&nbsp; This prompted my
      first venture into the Codename1 VM.&nbsp; I was able to find and
      fix<br>
      the TCP problems in a few days, and got the changes pushed back
      into the main development line with remarkably little hassle. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The second likely source of problems I had identified was image
      manipulation.&nbsp; My code uses an unusual strategy to construct
      partially transparent images for use at run time, and unless that
      pipeline could be preserved, then major work on the underlying
      graphics might be required; potentially a huge effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Specifically, my transparent images are constructed from pairs of
      ordinary jpg images, which requires efficient access to the
      original image RGB values, and the ability to construct new images
      from raw RGB values.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately this turned out to be
      close to a non-issue.&nbsp; All the essential methods for loading,
      manipulating and displaying images existed and worked as
      advertised.<br>
    </p>
    <p>There were many more steps like these to get the whole project
      working, but the underlying fact that the code was all known to
      work (in the original) greatly smoothed the process.&nbsp;
      Hundreds of bridge classes with "Error, not implemented" methods
      were resolved one at a time, with the original behavior as a model
      for what needed to be done.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Phase 3: getting the Codename1 (IOS) version working.</h2>
    <p>Theoretically, after getting the Android port working, the IOS
      port should be just a matter of submitting a new build. In
      practice it didn't work out that way.&nbsp; The IOS branch of
      Codename1 is a much less mature product, and there were
      quite&nbsp; a few problems getting an initial version running at
      all, and then getting it running reliably.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Sometimes these required very painful debugging because the IOS
      version crashed with no other information.&nbsp; For example, I
      spent 3 days generating builds containing less and less code,
      until I <i>finally </i>discovered than an extra "static main"
      method left over from testing in some random class was causing the
      whole program to crash immediately with no information.&nbsp; This
      has since been fixed so the build process flags it as&nbsp; a
      build error.<br>
    </p>
    <p>On another occasion, builds starting crashing with internal
      inconsistencies, which turned out to be that the implementation of
      "Random.nextInt()" was generating bad values.&nbsp; Random had
      definitely been working the day before, and by the time I
      discovered and documented it, Random() mysteriously started
      working again.&nbsp; Some development work at codename1 had broken
      something for a few days, and I was the victim.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Several ordinary java constructions related to interfaces, or
      default methods in interfaces, either generated build errors, or
      built but created buggy code that crashed or misbehaved.&nbsp;
      These were mostly fixed by restructuring my source code to avoid
      the forms that the IOS branch of codename1 doesn't handle.&nbsp;
      Some of these have since been fixed in codename1.<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Surprises along the way.<br>
    </h2>
    <p>There were a number of noteworthy surprises that required changes
      along the way. <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>CPU speeds</b><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>As far as I can
        determine, all tablets are wimps, optimized for graphics and not
        much else.&nbsp; This caused almost all of my games' robot
        players to be too slow to use.&nbsp; About the best cpu speed
        I've seen in any tablet or phone is 15% the speed of a typical
        desktop computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; A zippy robot opponent taking 10
        seconds per move on a desktop becomes unbearably slow 60 seconds
        per move on a tablet - and that's the best case.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
        had to implement a new set of procedures for rating the cpu
        speeds and robot speeds, and to politely decline to let tablet
        users play against most of the robots.&nbsp; It's a big
        disappointment.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Lack of memory </b>I thought that a tablet with 512M of
        ram would have no trouble running my games, but it's not
        so.&nbsp; Both android and IOS are optimized to run lots of
        small processes, and have a strategy of randomly killing old
        processes to make way for new ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're not real
        computers.&nbsp; In the event, older tablets with 512M are on
        the edge.&nbsp; 1G is better.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Not a real window system.&nbsp; </b>Android and IOS both
        expect one active full screen process. Period.&nbsp; Even if the
        physical and pixel sizes are generous.&nbsp; My games expected
        to allow you to open multiple windows containing multiple games
        and the lobby where games are set up.&nbsp;&nbsp; After some
        initial experiments and arguments with the codename1 staff, I
        acquiesced and implemented a tabbed interface where all my
        independent windows became full screen tabs. &nbsp; The down
        side of this for me is that the layouts of game windows were
        "user optimized" by re-sizing them to a pleasant size. &nbsp; A
        lot of the new, fixed sizes were not particularly pleasing, and
        there are a <i>lot&nbsp; </i>of different screen
        geometries.&nbsp;&nbsp; Making the game layout code more
        flexible is still an ongoing process.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Unexpected use of Introspection, Clone, and
          Serialize.&nbsp; </b>Although I "knew" I didn't make use of
        these features, guess what, I did.&nbsp; Mostly not in any hard
        to replace way, but a surprising number of cases popped up.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Lack of thread safety.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>All of the
        codename1 window system is not thread safe, and there are a lot
        of threads floating around.&nbsp;&nbsp; Effectively all drawing
        activity, even offscreen drawing, has to be shifted to the main
        EDT process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Random manipulations of windows such as
        changing text messages, adding or removing windows, also has to
        be shifted to the EDT process.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Flickering displays </b>Android displays, but not IOS, had
        a persistent problem with flickering.&nbsp; Users expect a
        rock-solid picture.&nbsp; It turns out there are deep seated
        problems using dynamically created bitmaps to speed up frame
        times on Android.&nbsp; I'm avoiding these with some ad-hoc
        methods, but it's not completely satisfactory.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>IOS project build times&nbsp; </b>While my android build
        times remained stable at <i>1-2 minutes</i>, as I brought more
        games into the system my IOS build time grew
        exponentially.&nbsp; I finally stopped to study the issue when
        my typical IOS build time exceeded <i>1 Hour.&nbsp; </i>What I
        eventually discovered was that the IOS build has a "kitchen
        sink" approach to header files, so if you're not careful, even
        trivial classes will be compiled with all the headers for all
        the classes in the entire project.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several careful
        restructurings of the classes, especially to avoid making
        classes even theoretically visible to one another, reduced the
        build time to 20 minutes.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Missing and/or Mis-features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Weak Hash Map</b>s are mis-implemented as "discard on GC"
        maps. Just don't event try to use them in their intended way.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Font size and scaling</b><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Codename1
        has a poorly developed system for selecting fonts with size
        appropriate to the screen pixel density, which varies a
        lot.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Zip format</b> which I use to archive bundles of games, are
        not supported.&nbsp; I think they are now semi-supported in an
        external library.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Class.forName</b> not implemented.&nbsp; Not only is there
        no dynamic loading of classes (which I expected) but you have to
        have an explicit list of the classes you want to be able to
        instantiate.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Continuing annoyances<br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Some features which I consider to be absolutely essential are
        relegated to "premium" status.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two worst cases
        are crash logging and participation in Apple's beta program for
        new releases.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The build servers periodically become unstable, start
        generating build errors for no discernible reason.&nbsp; This
        problem has somewhat abated.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>IOS build sizes are <i>really </i>big as well as slow to
        generate.&nbsp; My complete android build is about 22M.&nbsp;
        The corresponding IOS build, in the app store, is 120M<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Silver spoon bug reports.&nbsp; If you're able to produce a
        single file, 100% reproducible test case, and submit it in just
        the right way, codename1 will probably respond
        appropriately.&nbsp; Anything less than that is likely to be
        waved off, argued away, or ignored.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    The proof of the pudding, as they say, is in the eating.&nbsp; My
    project is definitely a difficult outlier for Codename1, but I've
    now got two completed mobile apps <br>

    The process to create them was sometimes rocky, but I can't imagine
    any similar process, using another implementation strategy, to be
    faster or easier.&nbsp; I'm particularly pleased that I can now
    continue development in my traditional environment and simply deploy
    the result to IOS and Android.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's also notable that I
    remain completely ignorant of all the details of android OS and
    IOS.&nbsp; Not needing to know is a good thing.<br>

    I can't emphasize enough that this would not have been possible with
    a closed source product.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ability to immediately see
    what was going on "under the hood" is worth more than an army of
    tech support and a mountain of documentation.&nbsp; The ability to
    actually fix bugs in the product, rather than just report them,
    definitely made the difference between a project that could keep
    moving forward and one that was stalled, waiting for a fix.<br>
