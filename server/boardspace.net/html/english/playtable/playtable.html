<span style="font-weight: bold;">use the same Boardspace.net android app</span>. If you are using
it to play games on line, there's no difference at all (except that you'll be looking down instead of across). &nbsp;This guide
explains what might be different if you're using a Playtable to play
Boardspace games off line.</td><td><img style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" alt="a real photo" src="images/real%20photo.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><h1 style="text-align: center;">Using the Boardspace.net app on a playtable</h1><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(204, 204, 204);">login screen<br><img style="width: 436px; height: 287px;" alt="login" src="images/table-login.jpg"><br><br></td><td></td><td>If
the table has been recognized as a playtable, the login screen will
include a&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Table Name</span> field. &nbsp;Naming the table is optional, but
it appear to potential partners on the same network. &nbsp;If you're blessed to have <span style="font-style: italic;">more than one </span>playtable, it will help you decide which one to connect to. &nbsp;<br><br>To use the
table to play games locally, click on&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Play off line</span> to enter the game setup screen. &nbsp;Given the size and weight of the
playtable, you won't be&nbsp;passing the table around, you'll be
seating yourself around it.<br><br></td></tr><tr><td><img style="width: 800px; height: 450px;" alt="game setup" src="images/lobby%20screen.png"></td><td></td><td>Instead of the traditional lobby, playing on a table is organized organized by <span style="font-style: italic;">where you intend to sit. &nbsp; </span>Select
the the most appropriate seating chart from the row along the top.
&nbsp;This also implies how many players there will be, and acts as a
filter on the games that are available to play.<br><br>For example, for 2 player games there are 3 plausible seating charts, <br><img style="width: 170px; height: 53px;" alt="2 player seating" src="images/2-player-seating.jpg"><br>Ideally,
the layouts for the actual games will be optimized for the selected
chart. &nbsp;Achieving the ideal will be an ongoing process :)<br></td></tr><tr><td><img style="width: 800px; height: 450px;" alt="yspahan ready" src="images/yspahan.png"></td><td></td><td>After
you've selected the seating arrangement, click on the seat bubbles to
set the player names. &nbsp;After all the players are named the <span style="font-style: italic;">start</span>
button will appear. &nbsp; &nbsp;Where appropriate to the game, you can
also select the starting player or assign the color to players.<br><br>For games such as Yspahan, which have some hidden information, it will be possible to connect other mobiles as<span style="font-style: italic;"> side screen</span>s, running the same boardspace.net app to view the hidden information privately. &nbsp;See below.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h1 style="text-align: center;">Using additional devices as Side Screens</h1>Use
the same boardspace.net app, on any device you have handy. &nbsp; IOS
and PC based devices will work too. &nbsp; Phone size devices ought to
be fine, since you'll need it only for a few pieces of information, not
for operating the whole game.<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><img style="width: 669px; height: 425px;" alt="client screen" src="images/client-login.jpg"></td><td>When
you launch the boardspace.net app, and there is a playtable nearby
which is also running the boardspace.net app, you'll see an extra&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Join </span>button next to the Play Off line button. &nbsp;Join!</td></tr><tr><td><img style="width: 500px; height: 293px;" alt="table setup" src="images/client-join.jpg"><br>If there is a game in progress, you'll see an option menu like this,
which allows you to connect to the game and receive appropriate content
for your player. &nbsp; Generally speaking, the screen you get to next will
be recognizable and appropriate to the game. &nbsp;</td><td>For example the private
screen for Yspahan will look something like this:<br><img style="width: 400px; height: 234px;" alt="yespahan" src="images/yspahan-display.png"><br>where
the cards are hidden from the other players. &nbsp;You can click on the
cards to see them, and also can select them to be played when
appropriate.<br><br>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
