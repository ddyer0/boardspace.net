<br>All the game records saved at Boardspace are in <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Game_Format">SGF</a> </span>format,
a&nbsp;used game file format that is mainly used for the game Go.
&nbsp;The skeleton of that format, and basic syntax conventions, are
fixed, and expandable enough&nbsp; to accommadate a wide variety of
games. &nbsp; This file documents the overall adaptions you'll find in
Boardspace' sgf files.<br><br>Here's an abbreviation of a typical sgf format file at Boardspace.<br><pre></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> (;<br>GM[Majorities]VV[1]<br>CM[0,1]<br>TC[None]<br>SU[Majorities-5 2 18340105 100]<br>DT[Thu May 18 17:03:46 PDT 2023]<br>GN[MA-AntiSkub-ddyer-2023-05-19-0003]<br>RE[Game won by ddyer]<br>P0[id "AntiSkub"]<br>P1[id "ddyer"]<br>; P0[0 Start P0]<br>; P0[1 Pick W]TM[11896]<br>; P0[2 Dropb W A 5]TM[13462]<br>; P0[3 Done ]TM[14526]<br>; P1[4 Dropb B E 5]TM[2325]<br>; P1[5 Dropb B H 2]TM[4851]<br>; P1[6 Done ]TM[6703]<br>...<br>;<br>P0[time 0:11:40 ]<br>P1[time 0:04:44 ]<br>)<br> <br></div><pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">GM[Majorities]<br></span></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The
name of the game, generally the geneneric name for the base game.
&nbsp;SGF format expects the GM propertu to be an integer "game
number", which was used for the first few games at boardspace, but it
rapidly became too cumbersome to beg the sgf comittee to assign new
integers.</div><pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">VV[1]<br></span></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;">This
is the format of the SGF file itself, and should always have the value
1. &nbsp;If there ever were to be a drastic incompatible change, this
would become 2</div><pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">CM[0,1]<br></span></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;">This
is the mapping of colors from their "normal" values,whatever that means
for the game. &nbsp;This property is not present in older game records.</div><pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">TC[None]<br></span></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Indicates the type of time controls for this game. &nbsp;The default is None, and this property may not always be present.</div><pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">SU[Majorities-5 2 18340105 100]<br></span></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Indicates
the details of fixed setup for this game. &nbsp;This field normally
identifies the exact variation, board size and so on, but the details
will vary depending on the game and the vintage of the game record.
&nbsp;The "best practice" for new games is to include "variation"
"number of players" "random number seed" and "revision number".
&nbsp;So for example, this record is for<br><ol><li>Majorities played on a 5x board</li><li>2 players</li><li>18340105
as a random number seed. &nbsp;This seed affects things such as deck
shuffles and dice rolls, which will depend on the exact sequence of
random numbers generated from this seed.</li><li>100 is the revision/bug fix level</li></ol>It's
standard to include the number of players in the SU property, even for
games which always have the same number of players, and to include the
random number seed even for games which have no randomness.<br>The
revision number is a clue to viewers to what bug fixes or other changes
may be included in this game record. and will affect the interpretation
of the game record. &nbsp;In effect, this value allows games to be
replayed in "backward compatability" mode with the rules and features
as they were at the time. &nbsp;For simple games, it will
probably never change, but complex games developed over a long period
of time, it might change frequently. &nbsp; For example, Viticulture
started at 100 but is currently at revision 155. &nbsp;The details are
highly game dependent - consult the developer and the source code!<br><br>Note that this property is likely to change over time and acquire more properties if you look back at earlier game records. <br></div><pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">DT[Thu May 18 17:03:46 PDT 2023]<br></span></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The
date the game was started, in whatever format the local device reported
it. &nbsp;There is a lot of parochial variation, and some records
include unusual character sets.</div><pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">GN[MA-AntiSkub-ddyer-2023-05-19-0003]<br></span></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;">This
is the unique game name assigned when the game was played. &nbsp;Some
old game records do not contain this as an internal property, or include a less specfic, non-unique name.</div><pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">RE[Game won by ddyer]<br></span></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The result of the game, &nbsp;not always exactly the same format over time, and not present in some older game records/</div><pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">P0[id "AntiSkub"]<br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">P1[id "ddyer"]</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The name and possibly other properties of the players</div><pre><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">	</span>The first semicolon sepatates the general game properties from the actual record of the game. <br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div><pre></pre><ul><li>P0[0 Start P0]<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span>; P0[1 Pick W]TM[11896]<br>; P0[2 Dropb W A 5]TM[13462]<br>; P0[3 Done ]TM[14526]<br>; P1[4 Dropb B E 5]TM[2325]<br>; P1[5 Dropb B H 2]TM[4851]<br>; P1[6 Done ]TM[6703]<br></li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The
actual record of the game. &nbsp;This part of potentially different for
every kind of game, but boardspace generally used P0 P1 P2 and so on to
identify the players.<br>The details inside the [] for each move are
highly variable per game. &nbsp;Additional properties for each move are
optional. &nbsp; Newer game recrods will contain TM<br>properties, which is cumulative player time in milliseconds. &nbsp; Game records <span style="font-style: italic;">may </span>also contain C[] properties which are comments per move, and AN[] annotation<br>properties.</div><pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">P0[time 0:11:40 ]</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">P1[time 0:04:44 ]<br></span></pre><div style="margin-left: 40px;">total times used for eact player, hours:minutes:seconds</div><pre>)<br> <br></pre><h2>Other wrapper details:</h2><ul><li>There
may be more than one game per file. &nbsp;The multiple games could be a
deliberate collection, or it part of an automatically saved game, it's
an accident from some past debugging, and the second copy of the game
should be ignored.</li><li>Zip files are packaged automaically from recently played games.</li><li>Games may contain variations in standard sgf &nbsp;format.</li></ul><pre></pre>
