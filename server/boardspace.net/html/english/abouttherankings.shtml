    </h1>
    <br>
    The ranking system is an ELO style system, with a few tweaks to
    accomodate networked play.&nbsp; The main parameters are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>the center of the system is 1500.&nbsp; The average ranking of
        all active players should always be close to 1500.&nbsp; One of
        the tweaks is that a few bonus points are awarded to every game
        to continuously rebalance the system; so if players leave, or
        stop playing, the ranks of all the other players are gradually
        adjusted to bring the system back into balance.</li>
      <li>The most that can be gained or lost in a single game is
        approximately 20 points, in a game between players of equal
        rank.&nbsp; The stake is less proportional to the difference in
        rank, up to about 900 points where the higher ranked player
        can't gain points and the lower ranked player can't lose
        points.&nbsp; New players have less influence on the change in
        rankings, so it is hard to gain or lose points by playing
        beginners.<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cheating</span>:&nbsp; anyone
        suspected of playing games against themselves, or against shill
        players, or against the villiage idiot,&nbsp; for the purpose of
        inflating their rankings will be summarily disciplined.&nbsp;
        Likewise, anyone using any program not provided by this site to
        assist during a game, or using any tool or device not also used
        by his opponent, or .... you get the idea. Play fair.&nbsp; If
        you want to experiment, play unranked games.</li>
    </ul>
    Generally speaking, the rankings are a very rough guide to how
    strong a player is, especially players who haven't played many
    games.&nbsp; The rankings depend as much on who you choose to play
    as on how good you are.<br>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">About Master Rankings</h1>
    The master ranking system is a parallel ranking system, which uses
    the same basic formula as the regular ranking system.&nbsp; The main
    difference is that master rankings are based only on serious games
    between serious players.&nbsp; Eventually, comparing master rankings
    might be a fairly reliable guide to the relative playing strength of
    master players.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ok, so how do I become a
          master?</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The current benchmark is to achieve
        an <span style="font-style: italic;">honest&nbsp;</span> lobby
        ranking of 2000 for any game.&nbsp; The management is alerted
        automatically when a new candidate qualifies.&nbsp; Your recent
        games will be reviewed to be sure you're not using some trick to
        artificially inflate your ranking.&nbsp; Master player's names
        appear in blue ink in the lobby, and masters can play games in
        master rooms, which count toward master ratings.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">About the Ranking Ladder</h1>
    <p>The ranking ladder is a parallel rating system based on the idea
      that better players win in games against worse players, so there's
      a natural hierarchy with the best players at the top. &nbsp;
      &nbsp; Boardspace implementation of this simple idea is designed
      to encourage players to actually play, and to prevent players who
      achieve a high ranking from avoiding playing to protect their
      standing.&nbsp; Here's how it works.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ladder is based on powers of 2, with one player on level
        1, 2 players on level 2, 4 players on level 3 and so
        on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your level is intended to represent, roughly,
        your skill level.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>On any given level, the first player is&nbsp; whoever played
        most recently, and so on to the last player is the player to
        played least recently.</li>
      <li>When a human player plays a ranked game, he is moved to the
        first position on his current level.&nbsp; Robot players are not
        moved.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If the winner was on a lower or the same level, the winner
        moves up one level.&nbsp; If the higher level is full, the last
        player on the level is demoted one level.&nbsp; There's one
        exception to this; you can't advance twice in a row by defeating
        the same opponent.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Under this system, as long as you keep playing you will remain at
      your current level or move up.&nbsp; The only way you can move
      down is to not play.&nbsp; Players who do not sleep have an
      advantage!<br>
