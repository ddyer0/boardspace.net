<h1 style="text-align: center;">World Map of Players<br>
</h1>
<p>
The map below presents the locations of players who have been online
recently, and whose locations were guessed from their IP addresses.
Here is how it works:<br>
<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <font color="#000080">The core service for the map is to match
IP
addresses with geographic locations. The <a
 href="http://www.networldmap.com/">NetWorldMap</a> project is
collecting the data and making some nifty services, based on that data,
available for free. Among the free services is an API webmasters can
use to ask for latitude and longitude associated with a particular IP
address.</font><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <font color="#000080">When a player logs in, the login process
asks
NetWorldMap to guess his location, and if it is known with reasonable
certainty, updates the database with "last known" location for the
player. The latitude and longitude are also passed into the game lobby,
which can display a realtime map of the locations of the players
currently connected. If you would like to see the realtime map, log
into the game as a <a href="login.shtml">guest</a>.</font><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <font color="#000080">The Map viewer is a small Java
application,
which interrogates the player database to get the last known locations
of all players who have played recently. The java applet digests
the raw data and draws circles on the map, based on number of players
near a given location. Obviously, this on-demand process is only
satisfactory if the amount of data involved is fairly small.</font><br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
