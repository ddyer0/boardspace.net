<h1 style="text-align: center;">About the Site</h1>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who runs the site?</span><br>
Boardspace.net is a hobby, not a
commercial site under
development, not a technology demonstration for a software
company.&nbsp; There is no hidden catch.&nbsp; Just enjoy it as my
guest.&nbsp; My home page is <a style="font-weight: normal;"
 href="http://www.real-me.net/ddyer/">here</a><span
 style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What's the process?&nbsp; How do you decide
what is included?</span><br>
Starting at the beginning, game #1
was Zertz because I was obsessed with it.&nbsp; Game #2 was Lines of
Action, because I had already written the applet for it, and just had
to adapt it to my new framework.&nbsp; Game #3 was Plateau, because I
really liked it and already had a working relationship with the
inventor.&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, it got more complicated.&nbsp; Some
games were momentary obsessions.&nbsp; Others were chosen in the hope
that they would be popular, yet others chosen as representatives of
some larger category.&nbsp; I've made notes on the "about this game"
page for about the particulars for each game.&nbsp; Perhaps
surprisingly, the process of choosing and developing a game doesn't
have to involve a lot of actual play.&nbsp; Part of the point of the
site is to get to play games that it's hard to find an opponent for.<br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">How do you get permission for these games?</span><br>
I
like
to paraphrase <span style="font-style: italic;">Surely
You're Joking Mr. Feynman</span>,&nbsp; "You
have to ask".&nbsp;&nbsp; It's generally pretty informal, and no money
ever changes hands.<br>
    </span></li>
  <li><b>Where do you get the actual games?<br>
    </b>There are several answers to this, but the most common answer
is that I buy them.&nbsp; Commercial games are easy.&nbsp; Ebay and
BoardgameGeek marketplace account for most of the rest - you just have
to be patient to get the games you want for a reasonable
price.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've made a few games myself, and some are
completely imaginary - they exist only on your computer
screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the most part, I don't get free games (but I do
accept them with a provision of "no strings attached").<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>What about community input?<br>
    </b><span style="font-style: italic;">Santorini </span>and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Micropul </span>are on Boardspace
primarily because they had a loyal following on BoardGameGeek, and rose
to the top of&nbsp; the "Proposed Boardspace.net games" geeklist I
maintain there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Games that other people like (and are the
kind of games I like too) definitely get promoted on my list of
candidates for inclusion here..<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">What's the Master Plan?</span>&nbsp;
The
plan
is
to
build the site into a place where you can
drop in anytime for a game with a human opponent.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has
reached the point where other players are likely to be present, but
with so many games, finding one you both play is still
iffy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The best strategy is to learn to like all of the
games, or bring
your own opponent.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">More Games! Better&nbsp; Robots!
Better Graphics! <br>
    </span>Etc. etc. etc.&nbsp; I'm always interested in
suggestions, especially suggestions with a lot of support in the player
community. Easy things and things that really grab my attention are
much more likely to be implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to
help,&nbsp; lets talk.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">What does it take to make a site
like this?<br>
    </span>No actual spit or baling wire is involved.
Here's <a href="sitecomponents.html">the rundown</a>.<br>
