<h1 style="text-align: center;">About the Robots<br>
</h1>
Select the robot to play by clicking on <span
 style="font-style: italic;">select robot</span> next to the start
button.&nbsp;&nbsp; For multiplayer games, if there are enough human
players in the room, you can also select <span
 style="font-style: italic;">No Robot</span> to start a game with only
human players.<br>
<br>
The robots are currently known as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dumbot</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Smartbot </span>and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">BestBot.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each game has
its own family of robots, and some are better players than others, but
generally <span style="font-style: italic;">Dumbot </span>plays well
enough to win against beginners, <span style="font-style: italic;">Smartbot
</span>in intended to play well enough to challenge intermediate skilll
players, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bestbot </span>is the
best available, challenging even for advanced players.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some
games may not have any robot, or may not have all three.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The robots are written in Java, and run on your machine rather than on
the server.&nbsp; Consequently, if the robot seems too slow, my first
suggestion is to buy a faster machine.&nbsp; I calibrate the robots'
speed and playing ability so they will respond at least as fast as a
typical human player.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Robot games are scored just like regular games, and each robot has a
ranking for each game.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ranked </span>robot games the player to
move first is random, and the games are remembered if you quit
them.&nbsp; Consequenly you can always quit to join a human player, and
come back to your robot game later, and also you can't get out of&nbsp;
eventually finishing a robot game you are losing.&nbsp; The robots are
happy to play <span style="font-style: italic;">unranked </span>games
and let you choose who will move first.<br>
<br>
If your opponent quits a game before it is over, you can let the robot
finish the game by clicking on the "actions" menu in the game
room.&nbsp; In these games, the robot's win or loss is credited to the
player who quit. <br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h2>What is the Robot's Objective?<br>
</h2>
</div>
The robots' goal is to entertain and train the human players, not to be
the best possible opponent.&nbsp; I'm generally only interested in
improving
robots that are too dumb to be interesting to play.&nbsp; In a few
cases, I've deliberately made the robots play worse than they could.
That's about all there is to say about 2-player perfect information
games.&nbsp; For games with more than two players, or with hidden
information, or with an element of chance, exactly what the robots are
allowed to know, and what should be trying to do, is not so
obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first rule is, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span>the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">robot plays to win</span>, but if
it isn't winning, or can't win, it plays to lose by the smallest
margin.&nbsp; This may have the effect of dragging down the leader, or
it
may not.&nbsp; The robot definitely doesn't try to play for second.
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h2>What are the Robot's Extra Abilities?<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Memory!&nbsp;
</span>The robots are allowed to be superhumanly good at remembering
things.&nbsp; In games like <span style="font-weight: bold;">Container</span>,
where the cash total is hidden, the robot is allowed to remember all
your transactions and therefore how much cash you have.&nbsp; In games
like <span style="font-weight: bold;">Medina </span>where the
buildings you have available would be humanly impossible to remember,
it remembers.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; </span>The robot
is definitely NOT allowed to know what the next roll of the dice, or
the top card in the deck is.&nbsp; But it is allowed to be superhumanly
good at remembering what cards are left in the deck, or what tiles are
left in the bag.<br>
