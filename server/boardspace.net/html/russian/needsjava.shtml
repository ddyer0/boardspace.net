    <h1 style="text-align: center;">BoardSpace needs Java!</h1>
    <!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/applettag.cgi?tagname=version" -->
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If the applet doesn't appear at
        all,</span> this is the first problem to solve.&nbsp; Our games
      require a Java-enabled browser. Most modern browsers support Java,
      but some installations don't automatically include
      java.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    The major causes of "no java" in browsers are:
    <ul>
      <li>If java is not installed, you need to download it.&nbsp; Or if
        installed, it might be an old version.&nbsp; Boardspace is
        designed to run with any modern version of java, but current
        security concerns make running old versions of java problematic,
        at best.<br>
      </li>
      <li>On all browsers, it is possible to <i>disable</i> Java in the
        browser's preferences, and sometimes the default is to be
        disabled, and not all installations include java by default. If
        your browser should be new enough to include java, check that <b>java




          is enabled </b>in your browser preferences.&nbsp; For reasons
        best known to the developers, this seems to be different in
        every version of every browser.&nbsp; Java.com has instructions
        where to find the <a
          href="http://java.com/en/download/help/enable_browser.xml">java





          enable</a> options for most browsers.</li>
      <li>Security measures may require you to grant permission for java
        to run separately for each applet or each site.&nbsp; Use the
        "activate all" option for Boardspace applets. Some confused
        browsers display a small red icon next to the URL line instead
        of a pop-up.&nbsp; <br>
        <img style=" width: 180px; height: 31px;" alt="the button"
          src="../images/appletbutton.jpg">&nbsp; Click on it and select
        "activate all" </li>
      <li>If all else fails, uninstall all versions of java your machine
        thinks are installed and reinstall just the latest.</li>
    </ul>
    Two sites that will help you test and diagnose java on your browser
    are <a href="http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml">Java.com</a>&nbsp;

    <h1>Firewalls, Routers, Ports and Proxies, Lost Connections<br>
    </h1>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">If you get some kind of "can't
      connect" message in the lobby chat area</span>:&nbsp; The Java
    applet must be able to open an outgoing tcp connection on <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">port 2255.&nbsp; </span>Most firewalls
    and routers are configured allow this; but some institutions (work,
    school) and some personal firewall products (blackice, zone alarm)
    may block this port.&nbsp; If the applet window comes up, but can't
    connect to the server, look for problems with port 2255.&nbsp; The
    applet will also fail to connect if it was loaded from some place
    other than Boardspace.net, which could be a side effect of some
    browser proxy setups.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.boardspace.net:4321/"><span style="font-weight:
        bold;"></span></a>If you get the message<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><font style="font-weight:
      bold;" face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">rcv 221 errConnection
      error</font> then you have successfully connected to the server,
    but your connection has been rejected.&nbsp; The most likely cause
    of this is that you accidentally connected to the server without
    going through the login procedure.&nbsp; This can happen if you use
    your browser's <span style="font-style: italic;">back</span>
    button, or if your browser has cached the login page (and so didn't
    to chat with the server about your login).&nbsp; Check your browser
    cache settings.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">If you lose connection in mid-game:
    </span>don't panic, you can reconnect and rejoin the game.&nbsp;
    This can happen for a variety of reasons, most of which are
    impossible to predict or control.&nbsp; Watch the little
    spinner&nbsp;<img alt="clock spinner" src="/images/spinner.jpg"
      style="width: 65px; height: 17px;"> located next to your clock
    (and your opponents clock).&nbsp; The little arrow should change
    position at least every 10 seconds or so, and if it has not changed
    position recently, the color starts fading from green to red.&nbsp;
    After 2 minutes of no activity a timeout will occur and you can try
    to reconnect. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Slow&nbsp; connections: </b>Once the applet is downloaded, the
    bandwidth required to maintain the lobby and a game is very modest,
    and any type of internet connection should work fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    One problem we have seen a few times is that firewalls such as Zone
    Alarm interfere with the flow of data to the server without
    completely blocking it. We don't know why, but disabling Zone Alarm
    fixes the problem.&nbsp; A test for this condition is to switch the
    type of a game room, say from "Game Room" to "Unranked Room".&nbsp;
    The changeover should happen very fast, within a second.&nbsp; If
    there is more that a very brief lag, look for this kind of
    networking problem.<br>
    <br>
    If you successfully play games, but <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">scoring the game fails</span>: To score games properly, the
    applet must be able to make HTTP requests on either <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">port 80</span> or<span
      style="font-weight: bold;"> port 4321.&nbsp; </span>Port 80 is
    normally used by browsers, so it is usually open, but some sites
    enforce the use of a http proxy server by blocking port 80.&nbsp;
    Scoring a game fails occasionally if the server is unusually busy,
    or just due to random internet glitches.&nbsp; If port 80 is
    permanently blocked, try referring to boardspace.net as <a
      href="http://boardspace.net:4321/"><span style="font-weight:
        bold;">http://www.boardspace.net:4321/</span></a><br>

    <h1>Browsers, Platforms and Java Versions</h1>
    The Java applet that runs the game works in any browser that
    supports Java, but not all browsers or platforms are created
    equal.&nbsp; Be advised that running old, unpatched versions of
    browsers and/or java is considered dangerous. &nbsp; <br>
