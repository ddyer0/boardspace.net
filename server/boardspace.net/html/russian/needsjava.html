<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If the applet doesn't appear at all,</span>
this is the first problem to solve.&nbsp; Our games require a
Java-enabled browser. Most modern browsers support Java, including
Netscape 3.0 and newer and Internet Explorer
3.0 and newer,&nbsp; but some installations don't autmatically include
java.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
The major causes of "no java" in browsers are:
<ul>
  <li>If java is not installed, you need to download it.&nbsp; Or if
installed, it might be a really old version.&nbsp; Boardspace is
designed to run with all but the very oldest java versions out there -
version 1.1 or higher should be OK.&nbsp; Visit<font size="+1"> <a
 href="http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.jsp">Java.com</a> </font>
to test java in your browser and help you get it installed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>On all browsers, it is possible to <i>disable</i> Java in the
browser's
preferences, and sometimes the default is to be disabled, and not all
installations include java by default. If your browser should be new
enough to include java,
check
that <b>java is enabled </b>in your browser preferences.&nbsp; For
reasons best known to the developers, this seems to be different in
every version of every browser.&nbsp; Java.com has instructions where
to find the <a
 href="http://java.com/en/download/help/enable_browser.xml">java enable</a>
options for most browsers.</li>
  <li>The embedded browser in some versions of AOL do not support
Java. Use a browser
directly from your desktop, rather from within AOL. </li>
  <li>On the Macintosh, Internet Explorer does not come with Java
installed,
but it is possible to <a href="http://www.apple.com/java">download
Java from Apple</a> and install it. </li>
</ul>
Two sites that will help you test and diagnose java on your browser are
<a href="http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml">Java.com</a>&nbsp;
and&nbsp;

<h1>Firewalls, Routers, Ports and Proxies, Lost Connections<br>
</h1>
<h1></h1>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If you get some kind of "can't
connect" message in the lobby chat area</span>:&nbsp;
The Java applet must be able to open an outgoing tcp
connection on <span style="font-weight: bold;">port 2255.&nbsp; </span>Most
firewalls
and
routers are configured allow this; but some institutions
(work, school) and some personal firewall products (blackice, zone
alarm) may block
this port.&nbsp; If the applet window comes up, but can't connect to
the server, look for problems with port 2255.&nbsp; The applet will
also fail to connect if it was loaded from some place other than
Boardspace.net, which could be a side effect of some browser proxy
setups.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.boardspace.net:4321/"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a>If you get the message<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><font style="font-weight: bold;"
 face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">rcv 221 errConnection error</font>
then you have successfully connected to the server, but your connection
has been rejected.&nbsp; The most likely cause of this is that you
accidentally connected to the server without going through the login
procedure.&nbsp; This can happen if you use your browser's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">back</span>
button, or if your browser has cached the login page (and so didn't to
chat with the server about your login).&nbsp; Check your browser cache
settings.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If you lose connection in mid-game: </span>don't
panic,
you
can reconnect and rejoin the game.&nbsp; This can happen for
a
variety of reasons, most of which are impossible to predict or
control.&nbsp; Watch the little spinner&nbsp;<img alt="clock spinner"
 src="/images/spinner.jpg" style="width: 65px; height: 17px;">
located next to your clock (and your opponents clock).&nbsp; The little
arrow should change position at least every 10 seconds or so, and if it
has not changed position recently, the color starts fading from green
to red.&nbsp; After 2 minutes of no activity a timeout will occur and
you
can try to reconnect. <br>
<br>
<b>Slow&nbsp; connections: </b>Once the applet is downloaded, the
bandwidth required to
maintain the lobby and a game is very modest, and any type of internet
connection should work fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; One problem we have seen a few
times is that firewalls such as Zone Alarm interfere with the flow of
data to the server without completely blocking it. We don't know why,
but disabling Zone Alarm fixes the problem.&nbsp; A test for this
condition is to switch the type of a game room, say from "Game Room" to
"Unranked Room".&nbsp; The changeover should happen very fast, within
a second.&nbsp; If there is more that a very brief lag, look for this
kind of networking problem.<br>
<br>
If you successfully play games, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">scoring
the
game
fails</span>: To
score games properly, the
applet must be able to make HTTP requests on either <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">port 80</span> or<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> port 4321.&nbsp; </span>Port 80 is
normally used by browsers, so it is usually open, but some sites
enforce the use of a http proxy server by blocking port 80.&nbsp;
Scoring a game fails occasionally if the server is unusually busy, or
just due to random internet glitches.&nbsp; If port 80 is permanantly
blocked, try referring to boardspace.net as <a
 href="http://boardspace.net:4321/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">http://www.boarspace.net:4321/</span></a><br>

<h1>Browsers, Platforms and Java Versions</h1>
The Java applet that runs the game works in any browser that supports
Java, but not all browsers or platforms are created equal.&nbsp; None
of them are perfect, but some are much more trouble prone than
others.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="+1"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Windows (any version)</span></font><br>
<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Seamonkey
and
Firefox,
</span>which are the latest browserdescendants of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Mozilla </span>and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Netscape </span>are the
best.&nbsp;&nbsp; These versions use a java pluigin from sun which is
much more reliable.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Internet Explorer</span> (6 or
greater) works, but is the most trouble
prone of the major browsers; especially "out of memory" errors tend to
occur.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
old <span style="font-weight: bold;">Netscape </span>and even older <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Internet Explorer </span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Safari for windows</span> is still a
beta, and doesn't work.<br>
<br>
Other browser choices are known to work, including&nbsp; HotJava and
Opera, but&nbsp; there isn't enough&nbsp; usage to make predictions
about&nbsp; reliability&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font size="+1">Macintosh</font></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><font size="+1"></font><br>
  </span></blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Safari
</span>works the best and is recommended.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a few
user interface glitches, but nothing major.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Seamonkey </span>and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Firefox </span>works except some menus are
missing from the top of the screen.&nbsp; The most annoying effect of
this is that you can't turn the sound off.<br>
<br>
Older versions of IE, Netscape and Mozilla usually work if&nbsp; the
Java
pluigin us configured correctly. &nbsp; The key
word is <span style="font-style: italic;">if.&nbsp; </span>The OS
developers and browser developers haven't always played together well,
so some there are gaps where some version of browser doesn't support
java for some version of OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Some olld versions of MRJ are buggy and do not work at
all,
even though they work with most other web sites; but you are unlikely
to still be using anything so old.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span

  </font></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relatively few of
our players
use Linux , the only general statement we can
make is that the most current combinations work ok. <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><font size="+1">Old Java Versions</font></span><br>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Boardspace works with&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Java version 1.4.2 and greater, </span>which is really old.&nbsp; No
bleeding edge features are required.<br>
