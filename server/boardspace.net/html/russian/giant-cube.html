Giant Soma Cube<br>
</font>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 120px;">We did a children's
show one spring and we used the soma cube for the setting. <br>
The cubes were made of a framework of&nbsp; 3/4 in tubing welded
together rightly enough,<br>
and they were covered with&nbsp; aluminum sheeting screwed to the
framework.&nbsp; The cubes<br>
were light enought that&nbsp; they could be mounted in many ways,
forming different environments<br>
as the play progressed.&nbsp; I did not invent the soma cube, it was a
popular toy in the 1960's.&nbsp; <br>
Since it was familiar to the young folks, I just adapted it to
work&nbsp; for us in this children's show. <br>

My friend Ken Clements and I found the cubes in a junk area behind the
art building, and decided<br>
it would be a good hack&nbsp; to construct a religious artifact at the
entrance to the administration building.<br>
Despite being "light enough to move" the damn things were heavy and
hard to manipulate with only 2<br>
pairs of hands, in the dark, in the dead of night.&nbsp; The security
guy later told me he had to delay his rounds<br>
for a long time to avoid interrupting us.<br>
