    <br>
    <br>
    The root of everything is the <a
      href="/cgi-bin/tournament-signup.cgi">tournament page</a><br>
    <h3>Generally Speaking:&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
    The specific details for each tournament will vary, but&nbsp;<i> </i>this



    is how tournament are run here.
    <ul>
      <li>First, obviously, you have to be registered to play, and
        generally have to have played at least a few games before you
        will be allowed to enter a tournament.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The<b> overall </b><b>tournament </b>may take a while to
        complete; a month is about the minimum.</li>
      <li>There will usually be <b>several </b><b>rounds</b>, in the
        tournament, each round lasts a week or so.</li>
      <li>Each player will have <b>one </b><b>match</b> to play
        sometime during the round.</li>
      <li>The individual matches are played online, at a time arranged
        at the convenience of the players.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The games in a match can be played in one session or split up
        any way the players decide.</li>
      <li>When the match is complete, both players report the results,
        then wait for the next round to start.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Contacting other players: &nbsp;<br>
    </h3>
    Once a tournament has started and you've been assigned an opponent
    to play a match against, you need to make contact and negotiate a
    mutually convenient time to play.&nbsp; This is frequently
    difficult.&nbsp; The other player may be anywhere in the world, and
    may have very narrow preferences for what is <i>a good time to
      play.&nbsp; </i>The preferred way to open negotiations is to
    leave a note on your match page.&nbsp; It's public, and it's the
    best guarantee to reach your opponent.<br>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">

            leave public comments, and record the status of your
            match.&nbsp; By default, both players are notified by email.<br>
            <br>
            The "find a good time to play" button uses the game database
            to find common times of day/week where you and your opponent
            have played in the past.<br>

            as prescribed by the tournament, and keep track of the match
            score.&nbsp; This usually involves some amount of chat, and
            perhaps a coin flip.&nbsp; <br>
            <ul>
              <li>You can chat privately in the lobby by selecting the
                player's name in the "to: button.&nbsp; Be sure, when
                replying, to do likewise.</li>
              <li>There's a "coin flip" action in the actions
                menu.&nbsp; You still have to agree on what the flip

              <li>When the game is set up, you can invite your opponent
