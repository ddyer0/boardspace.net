and 115 cards with letters A-Z. The letter cards are in 4 colors, some
cards have 2 colors, the wild cards have 4 colors. &nbsp;Some cards
have <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">stars</span> </span>which
multiply the value of the entire word by the number of stars. &nbsp;If
all the letters in the word have the same color, the value of the word
is multiplied by 2, and the word is <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">color locked.</span></span>
&nbsp;Color locked words can only be shaved by cards having the same
color, and can only be built upon with cards having the same color. &nbsp;A
few legal words can be made where all letters have 2 colors; these
words are locked for both colors, and score times 4.<br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 400px; height: 267px;" alt="fronts" src="../images/cards.png"><img style="width: 400px; height: 266px;" alt="backs" src="../images/backs.png"><br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup: </span>&nbsp;Shuffle the deck or decks. &nbsp;Players cut cards and the card closest to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Z</span> will be the first player. &nbsp;Deal each player 7 cards. The rest of the cards become the <span style="font-weight: bold;">draw pile</span>, &nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Turns:</span>
Players take turns around the table until the draw pile is empty and
either no more cards can be played by any player, or one player has
played all his cards. &nbsp;A turn consists of<br><ul><li>discard any previous word you have on the table.</li><li>optionally, make <span style="font-style: italic;">one</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">pre-play</span> and draw back to 7 cards in hand.</li><li>optionally, make <span style="font-style: italic;">one</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">word play</span> and draw&nbsp;back to 7 cards in hand.</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Scoring: </span>&nbsp;when
the draw pile is empty, and one player uses all his remaining cards,
the game ends immediately. &nbsp;If the final play was a word
play,&nbsp;the score for that word is doubled. &nbsp; &nbsp;The
remaining cards in players hands are scored as penalty points, as
though they were a word, including star multipliers.<br></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 50%; vertical-align: top;"><div style="text-align: center;"><h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pre-Plays:</span></h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Joker: </span></span>play
any number of joker cards against any visible words of the other
players. &nbsp;Jokering removes any remaining value of those words from
the player's score. &nbsp;If you have multiple jokers in your hand, you
can play them all.<br><br>-or-<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shave: </span>play
matching cards against the previous player's word. &nbsp;Each card
subtracts the value of that card in that word from the victim's word,
and adds it to the player's score. &nbsp; If the victim's word is color
locked, the shaving cards must have the same color. &nbsp; You can
shave only one player, and you can't both shave and joker on the same
turn. &nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation</span>: normally, only the immediately previous&nbsp;word play can be shaved, but by agreement shaving other words can be permitted.<br><br>-or-<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nothing.</span> &nbsp;you don't have to make a pre-play.<br><br>After a pre-play, draw back to 7 cards.</td></tr><tr><td><h2 style="text-align: center;">Word Plays</h2><div style="text-align: left;"><br>Play a <span style="font-weight: bold;">word: &nbsp; </span>play
up to 7 cards to spell a word. &nbsp;Normally "scrabble" rules apply,
but by agreement other rules can be used. &nbsp; The only 1 letter
words that are acceptable are A and O, not I (because it would be
capitalized). &nbsp; A word which uses all 7 of your cards in hand scores a bonus of
70 points. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Build </span>on
another players word: &nbsp; Take their word, add additional letters to
the beginning or end or both. &nbsp;Score for the point value of the
letters you took, but not the stars. If the word was color locked your
new word must also be color locked.<br><br>Play a <span style="font-weight: bold;">straight</span>: of at least 3 sequential letters. &nbsp;A follows Z. Scoring for straights is the same as for dictionary words.<br><br>Play a <span style="font-weight: bold;">flush</span>:
of at least 5 letters, all having the same color. &nbsp;Flushes score
only the point value of the cards, stars do not matter and or course
there is no color lock doubling. &nbsp; Flushes can't be built on or
shaved.<br><br>Play a <span style="font-weight: bold;">vowel</span>
play: of at least 6 vowels. &nbsp; "Y" is a vowel. &nbsp;Show the
cards, shuffle them back into the draw pile, and draw replacement
cards. &nbsp; 6 vowels scores 20 points, 7 vowels scores 40 points.
&nbsp; The vowel play ends your turn.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exchange</span>
cards: if there are at least 10 cards remaining in the draw pile, show
the backs of the cards you are exchanging, draw replacement cards from
the draw pile, then shuffle the exchanged cards back into the draw
pile. &nbsp;This ends your turn. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pass: &nbsp;</span>if you can't or don't wish to do any of the above, you can pass and do nothing.<br></div></td></tr><tr><td><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Challenged words</span></h2>There are a lot of 2 and 3 letter words that are found only in Scrabble
dictionaries; &nbsp;it's up to you if these words are used or not.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Palabra</span> might be challenged as "not an English word"; but it is now. &nbsp;It's the name of this game, so should be ruled as permitted.<br>In
friendly games around a table, any word that is accepted by a majority
of the other players should be allowed, and likewise, any word that is
rejected by a majority of the other players should be withdrawn without
penalty, and a new word can be played. &nbsp;If a player refuses to
withdraw a rejected word,&nbsp;then it can be formally challenged and
the agreed dictionary authority consulted.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Penalty: </span>for
a successful challenge is that the word is withdrawn and the player's
turn ends. &nbsp;Penalty for an unsuccessful challenge is that the
challenger forfeits his next turn.</td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Scoring Example</h2>P-A-L-A-B-R-A scores 12 points for the letter values, times 3 for the 3 stars on P, times 3 for the 3 stars on B, for a total<br>of 12*3*3 = 108 points. &nbsp; Palabra used all 7 letters, so add 70 points, for a total sore of 178. <br><br>If
Palabra were shaved with P and R, &nbsp;27 points would be removed from
the original score and added to the new players score.<br>(The R was worth 9 points in the original word, the P was worth 18 points). <br><br>If
Palabra were later jokered, the original player would lose the
remaining 151 points. &nbsp;The shaving player would not be affected.<br><img style="width: 800px; height: 479px;" alt="palabra" src="../images/Logo2.png"><br><br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternative Rules</span></h2>This
is your game, you get to decide the rules you play with. &nbsp;As long
as everyone in the game is playing by the same rules, feel free to
change the rules to suit yourself. &nbsp;Here are some examples of
&nbsp;alternative rules you might like to try.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shave Anyone</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shave Last and Next &nbsp; </span>Allowing more shaving tends to use up the deck faster, and makes a quicker game.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Eliminate High Score</span> remove the joker cards and instead, in the final reckoning, remove the highest scoring word for each player.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Simultaneous Play </span>Games
with 6 or more players tend to drag, because it takes a long time to
get around the table. &nbsp;Instead, everyone plays at the same time.
&nbsp; First, if shaving or jokering, place the pre-play cards face
down in front of the word they apply to, and draw replacements.
&nbsp;Then place your word face down in front of you. &nbsp;When
everyone is ready, reveal and resolve all the pre-plays simultaneously,
then all the Plays simultaneously. &nbsp;In case of conflicts, allow
all as though there were only one play. &nbsp;End the game immediately
when not everyone can draw back to 7 cards.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Impatient Timers:</span>
&nbsp;Add a 1 minute sand timer to the game, which is not used most of
the time. &nbsp;If you get impatient with someone taking too long,
start the timer.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">
