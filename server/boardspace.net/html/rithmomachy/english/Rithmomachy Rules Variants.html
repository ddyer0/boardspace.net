<h3>The flow of the game</h3>
<p align="left">As I interpret the classical rules, a game
would be a long slog, since captured pieces return to the battle,
simple exchanges have little net effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a
protracted battle to achieve an advantage of numbers, the victor would
march forward and form a glorious victory as a sort of
flourish.&nbsp; Imagine two philosopher-monks playing one game over
the course of several days.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<h3 align="center">Capture by Siege</h3>
A common description of capture by siege is that a piece is captured if
all of its 'ordinary movements' are blocked by adversaries.&nbsp;
The "orthogonal" directions are considered ordinary, and the "knight's"
type moves are considered irregular.&nbsp; So capture by siege
could occur for triangles and squares blocked at a distance of 2 or
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; If rounds move only diagonally, I suppose they
could be besieged by blocking all 4 diagonals.&nbsp; <br>

<h3 align="center">Capture by Ambush<br>
</h3>
<p>Some sources describe capture by Ambush as similar to
the custodial capture of Hnefatafl, where the two attacking pieces are
adjacent to the captured.<br>

<td align="center" valign="top">
<h3 align="center">Pyramids</h3>
<p align="left">Numerous special rules for pyramids
occur in various sources.&nbsp; Among them:<br>
</p>
<div align="left">
<ul>
<li>A special move 3 steps diagonally, only available
while the original pyramid stack is intact.</li>
<li>Capturing using the pyramid's total value is only
available while the original stack is intact.</li>
<li>Capturing the entire pyramid in any attack that
captures any component.</li>
<li>Optionally offering other pieces as captives instead
of capturing pyramid components.</li>
<li>Capture of the entire pyramid as a game-ending
condition.</li>
<li>Requiring capture of the entire pyramid as a
precondition to a glorious victory.<br>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<td align="center" valign="top">
<h3><b>Prisoners</b></h3>
<p align="left">The classic rules definitely require
the captured pieces to be returned to the back row of the board, in
service of the capturing army.&nbsp; In some variations it is
immediate and automatic, in others it is in place of a move.&nbsp;
In any case, the returned pieces are far from the action and have to be
moved forward to engage or participate in victories.<br>
</p>
</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">
<h3><b>Glorious Victories</b></h3>
<p align="left">The standard location of the line
defining glorious victories is ambiguous, but probably the usual
location is the enemy's original front line.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">In most descriptions, glorious
victories require the pyramid to be completely captured first.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">The pieces participating in the
glorious victory probably are intended to be only pieces under your
control;&nbsp; your own pieces or enemy pieces you have captured
and returned to service.<br>
</p>
</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">
<h2>Greater Victories</h2>
<p align="left">Standard rules also include "greater
victories" and "greatest victories" which use four pieces and
incorporate two or three types of the ordinary victories.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">These superior victories almost
always include the ordinary victories as a sub pattern, so in my
interpretation they're about style, or bragging rights.<br>
