;B[b3- e3]
C[The "Yearout Counterattack"]
;W[a3-c1]
C[It is not usually a good idea in the opening
to capture pieces on the edge, but this has the 
merit of threatening h6:e3]
;B[e3-b6]
C[?!]
;W[a2-c4]
;B[c8-c5]
;W[a7-c7]
C[!]
;B[d1-b3]
C[There is no good move to protect c5, so Black chooses to 
develop elsewhere]
;W[c1-c5]
;B[b8-b5]
C[Clearly, Black hopes to separate the units on a4, a5 and a6]
;W[h5-d5]
C[Prevents g8-d5, which would severely reinforce the b file]
;B[f1-f3]
;W[d5-f3]
C[White removes this unit from its own group, 
but it was simply necessary to prevent f3:d5,
which would threaten g8:c4]
;B[e1-e3]
C[threatening g1:c5]
;W[a4-d4]
;B[e8-e6]
C[threatening g8:c4]
;W[h7-f7]
;B[d8-d6]
C[Paul is persistent:  
this threatens f8:c5 and d6:d4]
;W[a5-b4]
C[d4:d6 would be bad because of g1:c5]
;B[g1-g3]
;W[d4-d6]
C[Deciding to capture an annoying piece, 
and also preventing g3:c7]
;B[g8-g6]
;W[h6-f4]
;B[g6-f5]
;W[c5-f5]
C[!? The threat to c5 could also have been met by 
a6-a5, but White thought it best to rid himself of 
another nuisance]
;B[b3-f3]
;W[h4-d4]
;B[e3-e5]
;W[c7-c5]
C[Black's lesser number of pieces is starting to
make its disadvantage felt. It is not true that 
having fewer pieces makes connection easier; 
in fact, having more units can mean more 
possibilities and more threats!]
;B[g3-e3]
;W[f5-e4]
C[Thus White completes his subtle blockade on the 
fourth rank to separate the dark forces; 
however, it is a rather fragile barrier and will 
require constant attention]
;B[f8-e8]
;W[h2-g2]
;B[e3-g3]
C[Prevents g2-g3, and makes a first attempt to breach
the blockade with e8:e4]
;W[b4-e7]
;B[g3-g5]
C[Attacking e7 and c5]
;W[g2-g4]
;B[g5-c5]
;W[g4-e6]
;B[e8-c6]
;W[e6-d7]
C[Hoping to play f7-d5]
;B[b5-b3]
;W[c4-g4]
;B[f3-d3]
;W[a6-c4]
C[! After e4:c6, 24.d3e4+ White would have lost quickly]
;B[c6-e4]
C[The barrier could not last forever, but it
has usefully distracted Black]
;W[d7-c6]
;B[d3-f3]
C[c6 cannot be taken: 
			  W\[e4:c6\]?
 B\[f7-f5\]+  W\[e5-b5\]
 B\[f5:c5\]++ W\[b5-b2\]
 B\[e7-e6\]++]
;W[d6-g6]
C[The decisive move, threatening both g6:e4 
and e7:c5]
;B[f3-c6]
;W[e7-c5]
;B[b3-b5]
;W[c4-e6]
C[There is still no threat to connect on the 
next move in this final position, but Fabio 
presented a lengthy scholarly analysis to prove 
that ALL of his opponent' s moves lose!
Black Resigns.  Congratulations to Fabio and Paul
for a keenly contested  and fascinating game.]
;C[\[comments by ddyer\]  I used LOAW to search the
continuations beyond this point, and found a forced
win for white in 3 moves.  The best line is:
 E4:G6  F7-D5
 G6-F5  G4-F3
 F5-E4  F4-E3
