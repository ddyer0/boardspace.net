;C[This presumably looks toward a block against
the left side.  Attaining and maintaining the block
will be difficult.]
B[E1-B4]
;C[This does a lot to negate the threat of the block.  The
three stones at the left are now free to "slide" to
escape the block,   C3 is under attack from C7,
D8 is blocked from moving in, and A5 has a handy
escape/threat.]

B[D8-D6]
;C[My strategy strongly favors taking "free" captures
such as this one. There really are no negatives to
this move: it moves H2 a long way toward the center,

over column E is essential to keep white's stones separated.
]
B[C8-E6]
;C[Unlike the previous case, H6:E6 would be subject to 
recapture by E8:E6.  Preventing A3 from becoming
isolated is more important.  This also overloads the
threats on E6 in White's favor.]
W[A3-A6]
;C[Good move on the contest for E6; it shifts the balance
of threats decisively in Blacks favor.  Unfortunately,
it's can be captured (A6:C4) which would severly 
restrict the mobility of black's remaining stones toward
their mutual center.
]
B[G8-C4]
;C[Black's pieces on rows 6 and 8 are severly restricted
from moving in the desirable direction.  Black's control
of  E6 is doubtful - after A6:E6 E8:E6 H6:E6 white would
be in good position to connect.
]
W[A5-D5]

of the center, for free.]

;C[This looks fairly innocuous, but has to be rated as a key
error: not from first principles but in view of what ensues.
The only obvious negative to this move is that it is open
to capture, but that alone is not enough to make it a
major error.]
W[H6-F4]
;C[This is an excellent, if obvious, move.  The stone
at F4 is incredibly influential over the next phase
of the game.  All of white's stones in column H are
inhibeted from effective advance, either by lack
of mobility or by the threat of immediate capture
if they move out.  My choice would be A4-C6, which
invites massive trade-down of material.  At least when
the dust settles, black and white positions will be similarly
disrupted.

;C[Considering that white has only had four moves, it is
amazing to conclude that his situation is hopeless, but
this is pretty much the case.  F8 and F4 effectively 
control all white's column H lines of advance. A2 through
A5 are trapped behind the wall, and there will certainly not
be time to move them all around it.  D4 and E3 are not
positioned to do anything useful.  Meanwhile, black has
obvious ways to go about connecting.]

domination of the center.]

connection at the same time.]

A6:C8 may be too little too late.]

possible idea it to give G8 connection problems.  It
would be better to try to control rows 6 and 7 more
directly, perhaps with A6-C6 and  A5:D8]

but white seems to be ignoring his pinned stones.  One
would expect a computer to play this way - improve the 
possible while ignoring the impossible to fix problem.]

control the B column, he now has all his pieces off row eight

passive is keeping his sides apart, and now must pay for it

no way for black to reconnect E1 and F1\]]

;C[I would have moved D8-G5, crowding row 5, connecting an
outlying stone, and restricting mobility of white's column H.
It's true that none of these goals are urgent, but neither is
connecting B8.]
B[B8-B6]
;C[White threatens a blockade against B6, but it will be difficult
to reinforce.]
W[A4-B5]

B[G1-D4]
;C[Obviously intending to connect quickly with H4:F6 and
H7-G6. Unfortunately black will get to move too.]
W[H2-E5]
;C[very painful for white.]
B[D1-D6]
;C[]
W[A6-A4]
;C[Maybe a good choice; the threatened capture of D4 is not
too worrying.  Another good possibility is E1-E4.  White may
try to make it hard for D8 to connect, but I doubt his chances
for  success.]
B[D8-G5]
;C[Intending to discourage E1:E4, but not good enough, as we
shall see.  Looking back at this position after seeing how 
the game actually developed, taking the capture A4:D4
looks better.  Attempting a blockade with A4-C6 is also
a possibility.]
W[H7-G6]
;C[Black is not dissuaded.  This looks like a potentially
fatal error, but from this point black has an ironclad
sequence of threats leading to victory.]
B[E1-E4]
;C[The threat of H4:D4 is now looks serious, but is not.]
W[G6-E4]
;C[Connecting a key orphan, and threatening rapid
connection of the other three.  H4:D4 looks like
a good sequence for white, biut it is too slow.
Similarly, E4:D6 does not help, even though
it maintains A4:D4 as a threat.
]
B[B6-G6]
;C[This looks good for white, but is not.   Black still controls
C4, and and has only to move in and connect there.]
W[H4-D4]
;C[Black's position is overpowering at this point, becuase all
he has to do is haul in his outlying stones.  White's stones
in column H are too distant to connect, and too immobile 
to be useful for cutting.  This capture is superfluous.]
B[G6-E4]
;C[Threatening E5 again is no use; black is too close to
to being connected.]
W[H6-H4]
;C[The threat against E4 is not important this time,
bcause black connects even if E4 is removed.
