Puzzles and Problems</h2>

<h3>
Are all positions reachable?</h3>
This first problem relates to most of the other problems, which are likely
to be attacked by constructing board positions without necessarily constructing
a way to reach them from the standard starting position.
<p>The question: starting from the standard starting position, what class
of board positions are unreachable. I can think of two:
<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="unreachable-1.gif" ALT="diagram of a matching position" ></td>

<td>All positions with two or fewer stones (of any mix of colors) are
unreachable, because one of the players would have won before the last
move was made.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="unreachable-2.gif" ALT="diagram of the described position" ></td>

<td>All positions with no stones of one color are unreachable (because
the game would have passed through "one stone of color remaining", which
is a win.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
My initial conjecture was that all other positions are reachable, but that
has been mooted by <a href="mailto:Joseph (JaKe) Kisenwether<jake@buttercup.cybernex.net>">Joseph
(JaKe) Kisenwether </a>, who pointed out two additional classes of unreachable
positions.
<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="unreachable-3.gif" ALT="Diagram of the position" ></td>

<td>Positions in which no piece has been captured and both white and black
have all of their pieces united. The reason that this is unreachable is
that whoever didn't move last must have united his pieces on the move before
last and the game would have ended.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="unreachable-4.gif" ALT="Diagram of the position" ></td>

<td>Positions in which both white and black have all of their remaining
pieces connected AND every piece borders a piece of the other color. This
is unreachable for a similar reason to the class above: even if the last
move was a capture, the player who made the preceding move would have completed
a winning configuration and the game would have ended.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><a href="mailto:Jorge Gomez Arrausi <jarrausi@picasso.lc.ehu.es>">Jorge
G&oacute;mez Arrausi&nbsp; </a>has pointed out a related class of unreachable
positions
<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="unreachable-5.gif" ALT="Diagram of the position" height=219 width=219></td>

<td>Positions in which one player is connected , but&nbsp; neither player
could have created the connected position.&nbsp; In positions such as the
one at the left, it is straighforward to generate all possible white predecessor
positions, which have one of the white stones at some other position on
the board, and possibly has a black stone where the white stone is now.&nbsp;
In the board at the left, there are exactly 330 such hypothetical white
predecessors.&nbsp; Similarly, black must have created this position by
capturing an isolated white stone, and since all black stones are adjavent
to white, black could not have just created this position.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The common thread in these classes of unreachable position seems to
be the argument that the game would have already ended. Are there any unreachable
conditions that dont depend on this argument?&nbsp;
<hr>
<h3>
How Many Checks are possible?</h3>
Actually, several related questions. Starting from a position where neither
player has passed up an opportunity to win, what is the maximum number
of winning moves available?
<p>Related sub-questions:
<ol>
<li>
What if the loser cooperates?</li>

<li>
What is the maximum number of threats to win that can be refuted? That
is to say, the situation changes from "no immediate threat" to "n threats
to win" and back to "no immediate threat".</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Shortest Game Constructions</h3>
What is the shortest possible game, assuming both players cooperate to
end the game as quickly as possible. The <a href="short-games.html">best
known constructions</a> are 9 moves for the standard setup, and 11 moves
for the scrambled setup. The 11 Move construction for scrambled eggs was
discvered in May 1999 by enthusiast <a href="mailto:Jorge Gomez Arrausi <jarrausi@picasso.lc.ehu.es>">JorgeG&oacute;mez
Arrausi</a><a href="mailto:Jorge Gómez Arrausi <jarrausi@picasso.lc.ehu.es>">
</a>Jorge G&oacute;mez Arrausi, who improved on the previous best result
of 13.

<h3>
<a NAME="stalemate"></a>The Stalemate</h3>
Are positions possible where neither player can move? I've fairly convinced
myself that it can't occur on a normal board, but with enough extra pieces
(for example, a fully packed board!) it clearly becomes possible. What
is the minimum number of pieces on an 8x8 board to create a stalemated
position?

<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="stalemate.gif" ALT="Diagram of the position" height=240 width=256></td>

<td>This elegant solution uses just 24 pieces, the same number as the normal
starting position.&nbsp; This position was devised by <a href="mailto:devjoe@wilma.che.utexas.edu">Joseph
DeVincentis</a>, as solution to a puzzle for a rather strange game known
as&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~dcr24/Nomic/Acka/">Ackanomic.</a>
<p>His <a href="http://home.connexus.net.au/~kii/treasure/T201C.html">message
</a>describing
how he derived this solution is quite informative&nbsp;
<p>This stalemate position has a predecessor, seen at the right, but of
course, that position has more than the standard number of black pieces,
so could not arise in a regulation game.&nbsp;
