              <h3>The "Parachute" variation</h3>
              <p>The "parachute" variation starts with half the stones
                in the "Scrambled Eggs" setup, conventionally the
                left-and-right half, with white at a2. Each player
                starts with six of his opponent's stones in reserve. The
                first six moves consist of making a regular move and
                placing one of the <strong>opponent's</strong> stones,
                <strong>anywhere on the board</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>After the first six moves, the game continues normally.
                The <em>Parachute</em> variation was invented during a
                NOSTvention, by David Voorhees, while in a restaurant
                waiting to be served. (No information is available
                whether the proverbial cocktail napkin was involved) The
                first game was played on the spot, using a portable
                Chess board that happened to be handy.

              Described by John McCallion in NOST #358, and inspired by
              "Cheshire Cat" chess. The standard starting position and
              the usual rules apply, with the following additions:
              <ul>
                <p>
                </p>
                <li>When a unit moves, <i>the vacated space disappears
                    forever
                  </i>. The hole it leaves can be crossed, but not
                  landed on, by any subsequent move
                  <p>
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>When a unit at any time is incapable of moving
                  traditionally, it may be simply removed from the
                  board, and its space vanishes. This move constitutes a
                  turn.

              <h3>Four Handed LOA</h3>
            </center>
            <p>
              In four handled LOA, one row of each color are marked in
              some way, so each player starts with six pieces, and can
              move only his own pieces. Play alternates between teams
              and partners; the first team to connect all its pieces
              wins.
            </p>
            <p>
              This variation was inspired by the German "Hexagames" LOA
              set, which has Fleur-de-Lis on one side of each piece.

              two players play. In effect, each player has to alternate
              moving his two types of pieces.

              <h3>Hamilton Circuit LOA</h3>
            </center>
            This isn't an official variant (what's "official" anyway?)
            but Andy McDaniel, co-author of the <a href="#loa-1.0">LOA
              1.0 program</a>
            <p> learned to play this way: </p>
            <blockquote>
              I learned about Lines of Action in 1977 from a letter from
              a friend. However, the rules had a modification. A winning
              position consisted of a chain of men connected in such a
              way that one could traverse all the men along the chain
              without repeating a man (in technical terms, the graph
              formed with the men as nodes and their adjacencies as
              edges must be a Hamiltonian graph). So a connected group
              that formed a Y shape would not be a win. Also a connected
              group of men could have a bubble in it that prevented it
              from being a win. ... I eventually tracked the game back
              to a friend of a friend, He used the standard rules, but
              I kept seeing ways to confine his group to Y shapes.

              <h3>Euler LOA</h3>
            </center>
            <p>As discussed in the <a
                href="loa-programmer.html#connectivity">Programmer's
                notes</a>, counting the groups to recognise winning
              positions is one of the more time consuming parts of a
              computer program to play; but there is an elegant way to
              calculate the Euler number (number of groups, minus the
              number of holes) without any kind of search. So here's a
              brand new variant: </p>
            <p><nl></nl></p>
            <li>a win is whenever a player's Euler number becomes one or
              less.
              <p>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Therefore, all winning positions according to the
              standard rules would still be wins, but positions with two
              groups and a hole, three groups and <em>two </em> holes,
              and so on would also be wins.
            </li>
