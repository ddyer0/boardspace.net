C[MIND SPORTS OLYMPICS , LoA section
London, 19 -20 august 1997

Herewith some fragments of the first Olympic Loa tournament.
The Loa section of the Mind Sports Olympic had only 4
players, who played 6 rounds with a 30 minutes limit. Strong
players from Knights Of the Square Table did not attend. 
Ragnar Wikman was favorite, being the number one player
on Richards PBEM server.

But surprisingly he lost his first game.

But black misses an oportunaty: 23.f1xh3 would have    
continue the struggle because f7xf5 is possible.
a variation: 24.h2-g2 25.f5xf7 26.d6-g3 27.d6-d4 
28.d5-e6 29.f5xh5  further investigations are necessary.

C[all stones are connected.

Kok and Wikman kept on winning and won Gold and Silver. 
The Bronze was for John Bosley from New Zealand by 
winning a playoff against Bharat from England.  Play can 
certainly be improved upon so the MSO 1998 should be a 
great fight again !

Loa strategy is still under development. These analyses
should trigger further discussion about this interesting game.
I invite the players to crash these analyses and improve the 
theory.
