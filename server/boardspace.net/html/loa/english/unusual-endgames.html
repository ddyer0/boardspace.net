<h3>
An interesting Historical note</h3>
I should start the discussion of unusual endgames by noting that in the
original 1969 edition of <i>A gamut of Games</i>, sumultaneous connection
was described as a draw! In the second edition, the rules were changed
to declare this a win for the player moving. The apparent intent is to
eliminate all possible draws from the game, and in that spirit any other
abnormal situations that may arise should also not result in draws. Here
is Sid Sackson's note in the preface to the second edition:
<blockquote>Claude Soucie and I are all that remains of N.Y.G.A. At his
request, I have corrected an error in the rules for LINES OF ACTION, eliminating
possible draws.</blockquote>
What other situations are there? For one, there is the definite possibility
of endlessly repeating sequences, which neither player is willing to change.
When I first posed this question to <b>NOST</b> members, it was mostly
dismissed as unlikely to happen, and therefore unimportant. But since then,
a possible endless repetition has come up in a <a href="repetition-in-loa.html">real
game.</a>
<p>What <i>other</i> other potential draw situations are there? I can't
think of any that can occur the standard game, but maybe you can? I don't
think it is possible to construct a position where neither player can move,
but it clearly is possible to create positions where one player or ther
other has no moves.
