<h2>the LOA Java Applet</h2>
The java applet used to generate some of the diagrams on these pages
can also be used as a standalone java application, to enter new games
and diagrams. In theory, using Java should make viewing these pages
faster, because it replaces most of the graphics. It also,
unquestionably, is an improvement in functionality.
<p>You can <a href="java/enter.html">download
a version of the applet</a> which will allow you to enter, comment, and
view games using your own java-enabled browser. If you use Internet
Explorer (not Netscape), you do not need JDK or any other java
environment - or you can use any standard java application runner. The
applet is also available as a <a href="#loaviewer">standalone
application</a>, runnable under windows-95 and windows-nt.</p>

<p>If you have any comments or suggestions about the use of java on
these pages, just drop me a line. Most of all, if you would like to add
some commented games to the collection, contact me! I'll set you up
with
a copy of the Java application.</p>
<p>My longer term plans for the LoaJava include expanding the current
front-end into a full playing program.</p>

<p>Some wise students (or their professors) have chosen LOA as an
educational vehicle.&nbsp; Here are links to those we know of.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students at the University of Alberta all had to write Lines of
Action programs as a class project, then ran a tournament among the
programs.&nbsp; The results are pretty interesting, and I'm told some
of
the programs are pretty strong.&nbsp;&nbsp; Read about it <a
 href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Edarse/LOA/">here</a>. . A web
applet is available which makes is possible to <a

<h2>Historical Programs</h2>
That is, programs you can't play, because the program or the hardware
it was played on no longer exists.
<h3>The Stanford Program</h3>
There was a program that played LOA, which I got from the Stanford AI
lab in the 1970's. It ran on PDP-10s and was written in SAIL. I have
the
program, but haven't been able to locate the author or any other
information about it. I vaguely recall that it played sort of ok, but
was beatable.
<p>If anyone knows more about this program, it's one of the things I'm
interested in hearing about.</p>
<h3>The Triple-I program</h3>
(This is where I enter the picture). I was inspired enough by the game
and by the Stanford program to write my own. It also ran on PDP-10's,
and was written in another (now obsolete) programming language, called
TRIP. I vaguely recall that it was more successful than the Stanford
program, but was still beatable, barely.
<p>Only a few other people ever played against this program, so its
true strength is hard to judge. I still have sources for this program,
and a few game records. </p>
<p><a name="plato"></a></p>
<h3>the <i>PLATO</i> server</h3>
<a href="http://thinkofit.com/plato/dwplato.htm">Plato</a> was
a pioneering computer system, designed for education. According to <a
 href="mailto:Ucalegon@aol.com">Philip Cohen</a>, there was a LOA
server which ran on a PLATO system available at Cornell, though it may
have been developed elsewhere.
<p>[may 1996] the Author of the Plato program has identified himself.
He's <a href="http://world.std.com/%7Emhuben/">Mike Huben </a>I'm
hoping to acquire some more bits about this pioneering system from him.
According to Mike, he's been writing LOA programs ever since. (I guess
we all have our favorite problems). Watch this space for more news.</p>
<h3>Others?</h3>
Given the scarcity of PDP10's, and the languages SAIL and TRIP, it is
unlikely these historical programs will ever run again, but it's
conceivable that the core evaluation algorithms might be revived in a
new program. It would be interesting to see what a modern machine
(perhaps a factor of 100 faster than the old PDPs) would do with them.
