    Lines of Action is a board game, of the same general type as Chess,
    Go,
    or Othello. LOA was invented by <a href="founders.html#soucie">Claude

    <hr><a name="wish-list"></a>
    <h2> Wish List</h2>
    Here are some items related to <i>LOA</i> that I'd like to track
    down.
    <ul>
      <li> <i>the Stanford <b>LOA</b> program</i><br>
      </li>
      I've got the program (or at least a version of it) but <b>who
        wrote it?</b>
      Here's what I know about it: It was written at Stanford, in a
      Language
      called SAIL. It ran on the PDP-10 at the the Stanford AI lab,
      circa
      1975.
      <li> <i>an ancient issue of Science (Mathematical Games)</i><br>
      </li>
      This is a fractured reference to a magazine article about <i>LOA</i>.
      What magazine, which issue?
      <li> Material from the <a href="#NOST">NOST</a>
        archives!!! There is apparently a lot of material, once
        published in
        NostAlgia, now mouldering in closets. Somebody dig it out!
        Unfortunately, I don't have any myself. Number One on my
        Nostalgia wish
        list is a series of articles by Ralph Betza on LOA strategy and
        Tactictics.&nbsp;<a name="SACKSON"></a></li>
    </ul>
    <hr><a name="authors-notes"></a>
    <h2> My notes about LOA</h2>
    Lines of Action is a board game of the same general type as Chess,
    Go,
    and Reversi. It was invented, circa 1969, by Claude Soucie; and
    described by Sid Sackson in <i><a
href="http://www.books.com/scripts/view.exe?sid%7EwgfQhB0nKimTx3M/ISBN%7E0486273474">A
        Gamut
        of
        Games</a></i>. To my knowledge, it has never been
    commercialized in the U.S., most likely because no one could figure
    out
    how to make a profit selling a non-traditional game based on such
    simple
    equipment.
    <p>However, <a href="mailto:Ucalegon@aol.com">Philip Cohen</a>
      reports
      owning an actual boxed board, published by a German company called
      "Hexgames". </p>
    <blockquote>
      <table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1"
        cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img alt="hexagames loa"
                src="hexagames.jpg" style="width: 307px; height: 256px;"><br>
            </td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">I have before me a wooden
              box
              containing Lines of Action,
              (c) Hexagames 1987 (a West German game company). Soucie's
              name is on
              the
              front of the Spielanleitung/Game Instructions/Regles de
              Jeu sheet.
              There's a rolled-up cloth board and twelve square wooden
              pieces, brown
              with beige fleurs-de-lis on them or beige with brown
              fleurs-de-lis. The
              advantage over checker pieces is that you can play
              four-handed or
              ambidextrous LOA with them by orienting the fleurs-de-lis
              differently
              on
              the four sides</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      .</blockquote>
    On the other hand, my few encounters with "Hexagames" while
    researching
    LOA suggested that it is now out of business, so perhaps my "not
    commercially viable" comment is valid after all. Helmut Wresnik
    reports
    that the "Hexagames" version is still available from a successor
    company
    called "Abacus"
    <blockquote>Abacusspiele <br>
      D-63303 Dreieich <br>
      Schopenhauerstr. 41 <br>
      T.: 06103 36626 <br>
      Fax.: 06103 65273</blockquote>
    I bet they have other interesting games for sale too!
    <p>Since its invention and up to now, <i>Lines of Action</i> has
      led a
      nomadic existence on the fringes of gamers' society. I was
      introduced
      to
      the game by my friend Dave Poole, who said it was "from Stanford",
      but
      otherwise had no idea where it came from. This kind of irregular
      introduction seems to be pretty much the norm. For example, Don
      Woods
      wrote: </p>
    <blockquote>I don't know, but I do remember that John Gilbert, David
      Wall, et al. had encountered the game prior to coming to Stanford.
      (They
      called it "John's Sister's Game", because they'd heard about it
      from
      John's sister and didn't know the actual name.)</blockquote>
    and David Wall wrote:
    <blockquote>John's sister, Jean Gilbert, introduced it to us; I have
      the vague idea she learned about it at university, though whether
      that
      was the University of New Mexico where we were all undergraduates
      or UC
      Santa Cruz where she got a masters, I don't recall.</blockquote>
    And the meme continues: just recently , Hwei Yin posted to <i>rec.games.abstract</i>
    <blockquote>Hey There Guys (and Gals)! I have a game for you to try!
      I
      don't think this game has a title, but it appears to be
      non-trivial. I
      saw it in an ancient issue of Science (Mathematical Games). We've
      been
      having a blast playing it. It requires a checker board and
      checkers.</blockquote>
    The game, of course, is LOA. This kind of life-of-its-own is the
    hallmark of a truly great game. It doesn't require hype or
    commercial
    motives to keep it going, it just lives.
