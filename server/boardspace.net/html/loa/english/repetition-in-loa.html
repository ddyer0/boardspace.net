<H1>Repetition in LOA</H1>
<p>
Since I saw the theoretical possibility that repetition could occur, I 
asked several active players, and posted a question to rec.games.board. 
Most of the reponses were negative &quot;never seen it&quot;, but a 
posting from Phillip Cohen was more interesting.  That post is the basis for 
this page.

issue of *NOST-Algia* arrived, and John McCallion's column 
contained an annotated <A HREF="loa.html#scrambled-eggs">Scrambled Eggs</A> LOA game with 
the first 
possible forced repetition I ever recall seeing.  The game (Walt Roessner v. Paul Yearout)

The interesting thing about the diagram is the 
possibility of continuing with 
<p>	B 31 g6 e6. 
<p>White can respond
<p> W 32 h4 e4&#59;check!
<p>Suppose Black moves back with
<p> B 33 e6 g6&#59;Check!
<p>White will not stand for that, and so plays 
<p>	W 34 e4 h4&#59;Check, 
<p>and we're back where we started.

situation.  Rather than have the game end in a draw, Robin and I 
would prefer to borrow a rule from Chinese Chess:  the player 
about to repeat a position for the third time must vary the move 
or lose.

<p>In fact, the game continued this way, so repetition didn't play a part 
in the outcome&#59; but clearly, it could have, and therefore can be 
a factor in real games.
