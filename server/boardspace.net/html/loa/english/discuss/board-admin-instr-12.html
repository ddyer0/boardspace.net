<P>
The Moderator Manager allows the superuser to add, remove, and edit moderators.  The Moderator Manager is restricted to the superuser -- ordinary moderators cannot access the Moderator Manager.  To access the Moderator Manager, click on &quot;Moderator Manager&quot; from the administration program Main Menu.<P>

The &quot;Last Logged In&quot; entry shows the date that the user last logged in.  A user is counted as &quot;logged in&quot; when that user enters his or her username and password for any reason (checking for new messages, posting a message, being authenticated for a restricted reading topic, or editing a profile).  Note that this does not necessarily update if a user reads messages without posting, so a user may have visited your board since the time that is displayed in this box.

<P>

<A NAME="delmod"><H4>Deleting moderators</H4></A>
To delete a moderator, click on the delete icon (<IMG SRC="icons/delete_icon.gif" ALT="[Delete Icon]" HEIGHT=25 WIDTH=25>) next to the moderator you wish to delete.  You may also use the check boxes in the &quot;Mark&quot;  column to select the moderators you wish to delete, and then click on the delete icon in the &quot;(Marked)&quot; row.  You must click on &quot;OK&quot; to confirm the deletion of a moderator.<P>
A moderator is completely removed from the discussion board system upon removing the moderator from the moderator manager (unless the moderator also has one or more user accounts).  The moderator is also removed from any groups to which the moderator belongs.  A moderator will have no administrative privileges when the moderator account is removed.  Note that you cannot delete the superuser (you can't delete yourself).<P>
<A NAME="editmod"><H4>Editing moderators</H4></A>
The superuser can set a moderators's full name, e-mail address, e-mail notification option, password, and, in the professional version, any other personal profile options that the moderator can set.  The moderator can also be disallowed from editing his or her own profile.<P>
To edit a moderator, click on the edit icon (<IMG SRC="icons/edit_icon.gif" ALT="[Edit Icon]" HEIGHT=25 WIDTH=25>) next to the moderator you wish to edit.  Use the resulting interface just as you would use the Profile Editor when you edit your own profile.
<P>
<A NAME="grpmod"><H4>Moderator editing privileges</H4></A>
The superuser can set a moderator's editing privileges using either the Group Manager interface or (new in 3.10) the Moderator Manager interface.
<P>
To edit a moderator's privileges, click on the group icon (<IMG SRC="icons/group_icon.gif" ALT="[Group Icon]" HEIGHT=25 WIDTH=25>) next to the moderator whose privileges you wish to edit.  On the resulting screen, choose the groups that this moderator will be allowed to edit, and then click the button to save and apply your settings.
<P>
<A NAME="addmod"><H4>Adding moderators</H4></A>
To add a moderator, under &quot;Add a Moderator&quot; enter the new moderator's (future) username into the &quot;Username&quot; text entry box.  Enter the moderator's (future) password into the &quot;Password&quot; text entry box and retype the password into the &quot;Verify Password&quot; text entry box.  Then click on &quot;Add this Moderator.&quot;<P>
