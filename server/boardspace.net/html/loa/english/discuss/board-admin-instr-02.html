<P style="text-align: justify">
To access moderator functions, the moderator must be logged in via the administration program. This is accomplished by selecting "Administration" from the main menu of the board and subsequently supplying a valid username/password combination.</P>
<P style="text-align: justify">
Simply having a moderator account does not in itself convey administrative privileges. Moderators must be added by the superuser to a group in order to have administrative privileges. Moderators may access the Page Manager, Access Manager, or User Manager only for topics that are owned by groups to which the moderator belongs. If a moderator belongs to a group that owns a topic, that moderator has full administrative privileges within that topic.</P>
