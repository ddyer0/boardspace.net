    <h2> Wish List</h2>
    Here are some items related to <i>LOA</i> that I'd like to track
    down.
    <ul>
      <li> <i>the Stanford <b>LOA</b> program</i><br>
      </li>
      I've got the program (or at least a version of it) but <b>who
        wrote it?</b> Here's what I know about it: It was written at
      Stanford, in a Language called SAIL. It ran on the PDP-10 at the
      the Stanford AI lab, circa 1975.
      <li> <i>an ancient issue of Science (Mathematical Games)</i><br>
      </li>
      This is a fractured reference to a magazine article about <i>LOA</i>.
      What magazine, which issue?
    </ul>
    <hr><a name="authors-notes"></a>
    <h2> My notes about LOA</h2>
    Lines of Action is a board game of the same general type as Chess,
    Go, and Reversi. It was invented, circa 1969, by Claude Soucie; and
    described by Sid Sackson in <i><a href="http://www.books.com/scripts/view.exe?sid%7EwgfQhB0nKimTx3M/ISBN%7E0486273474">A
        Gamut of Games</a></i>. To my knowledge, it has never been
    commercialized in the U.S., most likely because no one could figure
    out how to make a profit selling a non-traditional game based on
    such simple equipment.
    <p>However, <a href="mailto:Ucalegon@aol.com">Philip Cohen</a>
      reports owning an actual boxed board, published by a German
      company called "Hexgames". </p>
    <blockquote>
      <table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img alt="hexagames loa" src="hexagames.jpg" style="width: 307px; height: 256px;"><br>
            </td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">I have before me a wooden
              box containing Lines of Action, (c) Hexagames 1987 (a West
              German game company). Soucie's name is on the front of the
              Spielanleitung/Game Instructions/Regles de Jeu sheet.
              There's a rolled-up cloth board and twelve square wooden
              pieces, brown with beige fleurs-de-lis on them or beige
              with brown fleurs-de-lis. The advantage over checker
              pieces is that you can play four-handed or ambidextrous
              LOA with them by orienting the fleurs-de-lis differently
              on the four sides</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      .</blockquote>
    On the other hand, my few encounters with "Hexagames" while
    researching LOA suggested that it is now out of business, so perhaps
    my "not commercially viable" comment is valid after all. Helmut
    Wresnik reports that the "Hexagames" version is still available from
    a successor company called "Abacus"
    <blockquote>Abacusspiele <br>
      D-63303 Dreieich <br>
      Schopenhauerstr. 41 <br>
      T.: 06103 36626 <br>
      Fax.: 06103 65273</blockquote>
    I bet they have other interesting games for sale too!
    <p>Since its invention and up to now, <i>Lines of Action</i> has
      led a nomadic existence on the fringes of gamers' society. I was
      introduced to the game by my friend Dave Poole, who said it was
      "from Stanford", but otherwise had no idea where it came from.
      This kind of irregular introduction seems to be pretty much the
      norm. For example, Don Woods wrote: </p>
    <blockquote>I don't know, but I do remember that John Gilbert, David
      Wall, et al. had encountered the game prior to coming to Stanford.
      (They called it "John's Sister's Game", because they'd heard about
      it from John's sister and didn't know the actual name.)</blockquote>
    and David Wall wrote:
    <blockquote>John's sister, Jean Gilbert, introduced it to us; I have
      the vague idea she learned about it at university, though whether
      that was the University of New Mexico where we were all
      undergraduates or UC Santa Cruz where she got a masters, I don't
      recall.</blockquote>
    And the meme continues: just recently , Hwei Yin posted to <i>rec.games.abstract</i>
    <blockquote>Hey There Guys (and Gals)! I have a game for you to try!
      I don't think this game has a title, but it appears to be
      non-trivial. I saw it in an ancient issue of Science (Mathematical
      Games). We've been having a blast playing it. It requires a
      checker board and checkers.</blockquote>
    The game, of course, is LOA. This kind of life-of-its-own is the
    hallmark of a truly great game. It doesn't require hype or
    commercial motives to keep it going, it just lives.
