<b><font size="+2">LOA in the Eighth <a href="http://msoworld.com/">Mind
Sports Olympiad</a><br>
</font></b><span class="postbody">(reported by Fred Kok, Aug 25, 2004)<br>
<br>
Th</span><span class="postbody">e results of the MSO 8 Loa tournament
August 24th Manchester.&nbsp;&nbsp;
13 players
<br>
<br>
1. Fred Kok (The Netherlands) 5 -5
<br>
2. James Hepell (Great Britain) 4 -5
<br>
3. Carl-Johann Ragnarsson (Sweden) 3-5
<br>
<br>
Other players with 3 points: George Lane (GB), Jan Palmgren (Swe), Tim
Hebbes (GB), Dario de Toffoli (IT)
<br>
<br>
</span><span class="postbody">It was not easy. After 2 clear wins
Carl-Johann Ragnarsson defeated
well from a lost position but overlooked win in 1 and lost against
me.&nbsp;
And in round 5 Jan Palmgren could have drawn by repetition! (very
odd!) but declined a draw offer (he wanted a medal and didnt thought
bronze was possible) and lost.&nbsp;
James Heppell was the big surprise. He is only 16 years old and
beat experienced players. He told me only a few weeks agoo he learned
the proper rules of Loa. He had played it without the rule you can jump
over your own pieces! <br>

<p><b><font size="+2">LOA in the Sixth <a href="http://msoworld.com/">Mind
Sports Olympiad</a></font></b><br>
(reported by Fred Kok, Aug 19 2002)<br>
</p>
<p>This time MSO 6 was at the University of Loughborough near
Leceister,
England. The Loa WC had 10 participants.Title Defender Grandmaster
Nicolas
Koichi did not participate.</p>
<p>Fred Kok took his changes and regain his title with a score of 7 of
9.
It started easy with a 6 out of 6 start but two defeats ,one against
newcomer
Jan Hauglandt from Norway brought back the excitement. In the last
round
Fred won his game while Jan had an unfortune defeat but Jan was
satisfied
with his silver (6 out of 9). The bronze was won by George Miller from
England
with 5 out of 9.<br>
<br>
I noticed that 1.d1-b3 was more than ever met with 1..h5-f7. In 2001
&nbsp;mostly
1...a5-c7 was played.<br>
The time limit was only 10 minutes so the weirdest things happened
during
the ever so difficult endgame.<br>
</p>

LOA in the Fourth <a href="http://msoworld.com/">Mind Sports Olympiad</a></font></b>
<br>
(reported by Fred Kok)</p>
<p>The MSO LOA tournament in 2000 had 22 players.</p>
<p>We played 7 rounds with a 30 minutes time limit, and "olympiad"
rules;
repetition of moves is allowed and is scored a draw. If the two players
both
have connected groups it is a draw too. Needless to say no draws were
scored!
</p>
<p>Many new talented players took part and collected the medals.</p>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;Jochen Drechsler from Germany had GOLD with a score of 6/7
and
is the new world champion.</li>
  <li>Koichi Nicholas from Englang had SILVER with a score of 6/7</li>
  <li>Demis Hassibis from England had BRONZE with a score of 5/7</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
There was also a LOA computer tournament with very strong programs,
already
capable to beat the top LOA players.</p>

<p><b><font size="+2">LOA in the Third <a href="http://msoworld.com/">Mind
Sports Olympiad</a></font></b><br>
(reported by Lies Kok, 1999)</p>
<p>The 3 th world championship has been held with 18 contestants
(compared
to 4 in 1997&nbsp; and 8 in 1998).</p>
<p>The world champion of 1998 and current no 1 on the Loa Internet
standings,
Hartmut Thordsen, lost two games on the first day, which gave Fred Kok
a
2 point lead which Hartmut could not overtake; even by winning against
Fred
Kok in round 6.</p>
<p>Because Fred Kok won everything else the Gold returned to the 1997
winner.
</p>
<p>The 1st prize was 300 pounds, the 2nd was 150 pounds, the 3rd was 50
pounds.
</p>
<p>Fred Kok was awarded the grandmaster title by the MSO committee.</p>
<p>Ragnar Wikman was awarded the international master title.</p>

<p><b><font size="+2">LOA in the Second <a href="http://msoworld.com/">Mind
Sports Olympiad</a></font></b><br>
(reported by Lies Kok, 1998)</p>
<p>The second World Championship Lines of Action has been held at the
Mind
sports Olympiad at London, Hammersmith. This time 8 players from
various European
countries played a very interesting tournament with a time limit of 30
minutes.
</p>
<p>Last winner, Fred Kok and runner-up Ragnar Wikman had some pretty
hard
competition from two strong newcomers to the scene, Hartmut Thrordsen
from
Germany and Marc Tastet from France.</p>
<p>The title holder lost in the fist round to an outsider then won two
hard-fought
games against Marc Tastet (with only two stones against an overwhelming
10
opponents stones ) and Hartmut Thordsen. After 5 rounds Tastet, Kok,
Wikman
and Thordsen had each 4 points so the 6th round was crucial. Fred Kok
lost
against Ragnar Wikman and Hartmut Thordsen won over Marc Tastet . In
the
last round a real final for the gold : Hartmut Thordsen against Ragnar
Wikman
and Hartmut won and took the world title !! Wikman, Tastet and Kok
shared
the 2nd place and there was an exciting match for the silver and bronze
.
Ragnar Wikman took the silver and Mac Tastet the bronze.</p>

<h2>LOA in the First Mind Sports Olympiad</h2>
LOA is one of a handful of board games which was played in the first <a
 href="http://msoworld.com/">Mind Sports Olympiad</a>, in London, in
August.
Although it's billed as an Olympiad, its more like the Olympics in
1896;
an event by and for amateurs. Anyone can come to play and enjoy.
<p>This event is being organized by David Levy (of the famous Chess
wager)
among others, so is bound to garner attention from many who would not
otherwise
hear of LOA.</p>
<h2>LOA at the Olympiad</h2>
<h3>London 19 and 20th August, 1997</h3>
Gold Fred Kok, The Netherlands; PBEM as "tangram" ( 6/6 )<br>
Silver Ragnar Wikman, Finland; PBEM as "ragnar"<br>
Bronze John Bosley, New Zealand
<p>According to Fred Kok: There were only four participants but we had
a
great time. The internet players tangram and ragnar dominated the whole
tournament.
Fred Kok has supplied commented game records for the two games between
himself
and Ragnar Wikman, which can be <a href="../games/mindsports-1.sgf">downloaded
