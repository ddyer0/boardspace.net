<td valign="top">The game is for 2-4
players.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<b>The Goal</b>::&nbsp; the goal of the game is
to construct a 10 stop trip you could make in the London
underground.&nbsp;&nbsp; (<a href="#winning">example</a>).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment</span>::
A pack of cards representing the stations in the underground
system.&nbsp;&nbsp; A reference map of the London underground
rail system.&nbsp; Racks to hold 10 cards for each player.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup</span>::
Each player draws 10 cards, one at a time, and places each card in one
of the 10 spaces in his rack.&nbsp; Once placed, the card cannot be
moved or rearranged during the setup.&nbsp; Try to place the cards
so the fewest changes are likely to be needed to be needed to change
them to a complete itinerary.&nbsp; (<a href="#starting">example</a>)
After all players have placed their cards, 3 discard piles are dealt
one card each, face up.&nbsp; The remainder of the cards are placed
face down as a draw pile.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Play</span>:
Each turn:<br>
<ol>
<li>The current player draws one card from the top of
either one of the discard piles or the draw pile.</li>
<li>The card can optionally (and usually will) be
exchanged for one card in the player's rack.</li>
<li>The exchanged card is placed on any of the three
discard piles, unless one pile is empty, in which case the discard must
be placed on the empty space.<br>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Game End:</span>&nbsp;
Play continues clockwise until some player has a valid 10 station <i>continuous
journey</i>.<br>

<li>You can travel as far as you like on any line, as

a train, cross to the other side, and go back the way you came.</li>
<li>You&nbsp;can change lines at any station,
including changing lines to another moving in the same direction on the
same track.<br>
</li>
<li>You <i>may </i>use a line or a station
more than once, including backtracking, if you've used another line in

<h3 align="center">FAQ and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reality Check</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span>The
stations and lines accurately represent zone 1 of the London
underground, with one major and one minor
exception.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>major </b>exception
is that there is no Circle line in the game.&nbsp; All the stations
on the circle line except one are also on at least one other line, so
the connectivity of the system is unchanged, except for the <b>minor
exception </b>that stations <i>Aldgate</i>
and&nbsp; <i>Aldgate East </i>have been
combined.&nbsp; In reality they are a short distance apart.<br>
<br>
More generally, the absence of the rest of the system "everything
except zone 1" means you can't use this game to plan actual trips, or
expect what's permitted in the game to match what you would do in
reality.&nbsp; The reality is, if you're standing on the platform
and a train arrives traveling in your intended direction, you usually
just get on it.&nbsp; You can always get off at the next stop and
be closer to your destination.&nbsp; A "better" train that might be
following can always be taken from your new position, if it arrives.<br>
<br>
Also note that the lines don't actually end at the points they end in
the game - they continue on into zone 2.&nbsp; The stops and
stations in the game reflect what you would have to do to remain in
zone 1 (and avoid paying an additional fare).<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Why can't I go "the short way" from Waterloo
to Elephant on the Northern Line?</b>&nbsp; The east and west
branches of the Northern line meet in Kensington, which is in zone
2.&nbsp; So to go that way, you would have to both change trains
(from a southbound to a northbound) and pay a fare.<br>
</li>
</ul>
