<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rules for
Circle of Life </strong></h1>

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

<h2></h2>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Critter</em>: any connected group of
same-color stones on the board is a critter. A single stone is also a
critter. </li>
<li><em>Circle of Life</em>: surrounding the
board is the Circle of Life, which shows how critters of different
species feed. Each species is defined by its shape and can eat one
other species, as indicated by arrows &#8211; if an arrow points from species
A to species B, then A can eat B. All possible species of up to 4
stones are represented on the Circle of Life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
<p>The board begins empty. Players take turns. Each turn
has two steps, taken in order:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Evolve</em>: you must place one stone
of your color on any empty space, with one restriction: you may not
make a critter containing more than 4 stones. </li>
<li><em>Feed</em>: the critter you evolved in
step 1 must eat all enemy critters which are adjacent to it and on
which it can feed, per the Circle of Life. Remove eaten critters from
the board.</li>
</ol>
<p>A player wins when she either can&#8217;t evolve on her turn
(meaning she&#8217;s filled up the ecosystem as much as possible), or has
eaten at least 20 stones.</p>

<p>In the example above, orange first places a stone to create a
3-stone critter, then eats an enemy critter.</p>
<h2>The game recreates key aspects of real ecosystems, with
minimal rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>It starts with simple species, which evolve to become more
diverse and complex.</li>
<li>Species get more complex as you go up the food chain.</li>
<li>Simple species reproduce, die, and evolve at higher rates
than more complex ones.</li>
<li>When a species&#8217; population is high, another species often
evolves to eat it.</li>
<li>As in real ecosystems, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230301171828/https://www.quantamagazine.org/biodiversity-may-thrive-through-games-of-rock-paper-scissors-20200305/">intransitive
competition</a> enables biodiversity.</li>
<li>When a critter at the top of the food chain dies, it feeds
back into the bottom, to complete the Circle of Life.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Beginner Strategy Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t eat opponent critters when unnecessary. It&#8217;s almost
always better to delay eating to the last moment. When you eat your
opponent&#8217;s critter, you also give your opponent more flexibility.</li>
<li>If a critter of yours is sure to be eaten, try to exploit
the situation by eating the critter that threatens to eat yours, or set
yourself up to eat it after it eats yours.</li>
<li>Size-4 critters can&#8217;t evolve, which means if they can be
eaten, they will be. Be aware of all the possible ways your opponent
can eat a size-4 critter you might make and (usually) don&#8217;t make it if
they can eat it.</li>
<li>Be aware of the balance between stones played and stones
captured as you grow each critter. For example, let&#8217;s say you have a
2-stone critter that eats an enemy&#8217;s 1-stone critter, then grows into a
3-stone critter that eats 3 of the opponent&#8217;s 2-stone critters. That&#8217;s
3 friendly stones added to the board, for 7 enemy stones removed. Even
if your opponent eats your size-3 critter, you&#8217;ll be ahead after the
exchange. </li>
<li>Try to minimize the number of moves you have left to play
and maximize your opponent&#8217;s. In the late stage if there is no tactical
advantage to be gained, fill the cells that only you can fill before
the ones that both you and your opponent can fill.</li>
</ul>
