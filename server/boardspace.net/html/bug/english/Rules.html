<p>A <em>bug</em> is an entire group of connected,
same-color stones on the board. A single stone is also a bug.</p>
<p>The <em>size</em> of a bug is the number of
stones it contains.</p>
<p>The board starts empty. Black begins the game by placing one
black stone on any empty space. Then, starting with White, the players
take turns. Each turn has 3 steps, taken in order: 1) Grow, 2) Eat, 3)
Bonus Grow</p>
<p>1) Grow: Place a stone on an empty space to either start a new
bug or grow one of your preexisting bugs by one stone. You may not
merge bugs, and you may not grow a bug to be larger than the largest
bug on the board (regardless of color) prior to placement.</p>
<p>2) Eat: All your bugs which are adjacent to one or more enemy
bugs of the same shape (possibly rotated and reflected) must eat
(capture) those enemy bugs.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">2a) If eating would
unavoidably force a bug to grow by more than 1 through a merger with
another bug of the same color, no eating occurs.</div>
<p>3) Bonus Grow: Increase the size of each of your bugs that
ate, by exactly 1, by placing a stone of your color on any empty space
adjacent to each such bug.</p>
<p>If, after growing, a bug is adjacent to an identically-shaped
enemy bug, it must eat the enemy bug (and grow again) if possible, and
so on.</p>
<p>The first player who CANNOT place a stone in the placement
step WINS.</p>

<br>
Rule 2a is &nbsp;somewhat &nbsp;counter intuitive.
&nbsp;Without &nbsp;rule &nbsp;2a, if &nbsp;eating
would occur &nbsp;when no growth was possible,<br>
an infinite loop of 1 &nbsp;stone &nbsp;captures would be
possible. &nbsp;Many rules to remove this undesirable
&nbsp;behavior are possible. &nbsp;<br>Under rule 2a, &nbsp;a symmetric set of black and white bugs remain on the board even though one would normally capture<br>the other.<br><img style="width: 427px; height: 396px;" alt="no capture" src="nocapture.jpg"><br><br>White plays B6 , but no capture occurs<br><img style="width: 400px; height: 406px;" alt="suprise capture" src="nocapture2.jpg"><br>Black's next move: &nbsp;E3, &nbsp;B5 is captured and both A4 and C7 are elgible to grow. &nbsp;Growth phase<br>continues until no more growth is possible.<br><br>
