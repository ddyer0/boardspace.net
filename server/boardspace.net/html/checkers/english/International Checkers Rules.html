<p>The International checkers variant is played just like the
American checkers or British draughts, with these significant differences:</p><ul><li>the board size is 10x10, starting with 20 men per side.</li><li>men move forward diagonally. &nbsp;Men that move into the last row become kings by adding a second man to make a stack of 2.</li><li>men capture <span style="font-style: italic;">adjacent</span> men of the other color, forward or backward, by jumping if there is an empty landing square immediately after.</li><li>captures can be either forward or backward, and are mandatory as long as more captures are possible.</li><li>if there are multiple possible capturing sequences, one with the greatest number of captures must be chosen.</li><li>during
multiple captures, the captured pieces are treated as if&nbsp;still "on
the board" and , and it is not permitted to jump the same piece twice
or land in the space previously occupied by a captured piece.</li><li>kings "fly"; they move forward or backward and can skip empry spaces before and after a jumped piece.</li><li>kings
are created only if a man ends its turn in the king row. &nbsp;If it is
forced to continue capturing, it remains a regular maings "fly"; they can skip empry spaces before and after a jumped piece.</li></ul><p>Conditions for a Draw:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Mutual agreement
of the players.&nbsp;</li><li>The same position occurs
three times</li><li>Both players have kings, and both players have made 25 king moves without captures or moving a man.</li><li>Both players have 3 or fewer pieces,&nbsp;and both players have made 16 king moves without captures or moving a man.</li></ul></body></html>
