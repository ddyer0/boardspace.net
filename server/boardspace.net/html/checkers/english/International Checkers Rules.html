<p>The International checkers variant is played just like the
American checkers or British draughts, with the exception that it is
played on a 10 x10-square checker board with twenty pieces per player.
This variant is played mostly in European countries like France, The
Netherlands, Poland and Belgium and in African nations like Zaire,
Senegal and Ivory Coast. However, there are countries outside these two
continents that boast of good players like in the United States, Italy,
Israel and Brazil.</p>
<p>Rules of the Game: This game is played on a 10 x 10, or 100
squares checker board where the double corner is on the right of each
player. </p>
<p>The Moves of the Men: Checkers pieces can move forward on each
empty square to the left or to the right. When these pieces reach the
last line on the opponent's side they become kings.</p>
<p>The Moves of the King: Kinged pieces can move across multiple
squares on the two diagonals that cross their position for so long as
these squares are open, in a rule known as the "flying kings." </p>
<p>Captures: In International checkers, maximum captures are
obligatory, which means that if a player has more than one path to jump
to capture his opponent's pieces, he must take that path that will
effect the most capture of his opponent's pieces. If a piece lands on
the king row during a jump, it must continue jumping backward for as
long as there is a jump opportunity. That particular piece cannot be
kinged unless it finishes the move and stops on king row. </p>
<p>Captures by the Men: Men can effect capture by moving forward
or backward and jumping over a single piece of the opponent provided
that the said piece is adjacent to it and the following square is
empty. If the man can jump again from the arrival square to effect
another capture, then it must do so.</p>
<p>Captures by a King: A kinged piece can capture an opponent's
piece if it is on the same diagonal where it is positioned provided
that the squares between them are empty and that the square beyond the
piece to be captured is also empty. The king can stop on any square
within the same diagonal line and if another capture can be effected
from any of these squares, then it must continue to do so.</p>
<p>The Winning Player: The player who cannot move any of his
pieces losses the game.</p>
<p>Conditions for a Draw: A draw is declared by mutual agreement
of the players. A draw is also declared if the same move has been made
three times or if there are three kings playing against one and each
player has made sixteen moves without effecting any promotion or
capture.<br>
