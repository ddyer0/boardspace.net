<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Frisian Checkers</span> uses
similar rules to International Checkers, but with captures in all 8
directions, and more restrictive conditions on captures, and on draws
in the endgame.</p><p>Rules of the Game: This game is played on a 10 x 10, or 100
squares checker board where the double corner is on the right of each
player. </p>

<p>The Moves of the Men: Checkers pieces can move forward on each
empty square to the left or to the right. When these pieces reach the
last line on the opponent's side they become kings.</p><p>The Moves of the King: Kinged pieces can move across multiple
squares on the two diagonals that cross their position for so long as
these squares are open, in a rule known as the "flying kings."<br></p><ul><li>&nbsp;If a player has one or more kings on the board but also has one or more 
men left, they are not allowed to play more than three non-capturing  
moves in a row with the same king<em>.</em></li></ul><p>Captures: In Frisian checkers, <span style="font-weight: bold;">maximum captures are
obligatory</span>,
which means that if a player has more than one path to jump
to capture his opponent's pieces, he must take that path that will
effect the most capture of his opponent's pieces. A king is worth
slightly less than 2 men. &nbsp;If the same value capture is possible
using either a king or an man, the king must be used. &nbsp;If a piece
lands on
the king row during a jump, it must continue jumping backward for as
long as there is a jump opportunity. That particular piece cannot be
kinged unless it finishes the move and stops on king row. </p>
<p>Captures by the Men: Men can effect capture by moving in any direction and jumping over a single piece of the opponent provided
that the said piece is adjacent to it and the following square is
empty. If the man can jump again from the arrival square to effect
another capture, then it must do so.</p>
<p>Captures by a King: A kinged piece can capture an opponent's
piece if it is in line in any direction where it is positioned provided
that the squares between them are empty and that the square beyond the
piece to be captured is also empty. The king can stop on any square
along the same line and if another capture can be effected
from any of these squares, then it must continue to do so.</p>
<p>The Winning Player: The player who cannot move any of his
pieces losses the game.</p>
<p>Conditions for a Draw: A draw is declared by</p><ul><li> mutual agreement
of the players.&nbsp;</li><li>The only mandatory draws apply when there are only kings left, with <span style="font-weight: bold;">three pieces or less on the board</span>:</li><ul><li>When one player has two kings and the other player has one king, the game is drawn after both players have made 7 moves.</li><li>When both players have one king left, the game is drawn after both players have made 2 moves.</li><li>If the same position occurs three times.<br></li></ul></ul><p>
