<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Executive Summary:</span> &nbsp;<br><br>Stacks is based on <a href="Bashni%20Checkers%20Rules.html">Bashni</a>, with these significant differences:<br><ul><li>a
king is any stack with&nbsp;2 pieces the same color on top. &nbsp;Kings
are created (or destroyed) dynamically throughout the game.</li><li>back-and-forth capture is permitted.<br></li></ul>Conseqently,
there are always 12 pieces of each color in play. &nbsp;Because of the
back and forth capturing when to stacks are adjacent, complex
interactions can occur.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Full Rules:</span>
<ul><li>the board size is 8x8, initially with 12 men per side</li><li>men move forward diagonally. &nbsp;Men that move into the last row become kings by adding a second man to make a stack of 2.</li><li>men capture <span style="font-style: italic;">adjacent</span> men of the other color, forward or backward, by jumping if there is an empty landing square immediately after.</li><li>captures can be either forward or backward, and are mandatory&nbsp;as long as more captures are possible.</li><li>a man capturing and landing on the king row is promoted to King immediately, and can continue capturing as a King.</li><li>kings "fly"; they move forward or backward and can skip empry spaces before and after a jumped piece.</li></ul><p style="font-weight: bold;">Conditions for a Draw:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Mutual agreement
of the players.&nbsp;</li><li>The same position occurs
three times</li><li>Both players have kings, and both players have made 25 king moves without captures or moving a man.</li><li>Both players have 3 or fewer pieces,&nbsp;and both players have made 16 king moves without captures or moving a man.</li></ul>Stacks
checkers is unique to boardspace, inspired by intermediate rule sets
while I was interpreting unclear versions of the rules for Bashni<br></body></html>
