<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Executive Summary:</span> &nbsp;<br><br>Bashni is very similar to <a href="Russian%20Checkers%20Rules.html">Russian Checkers</a>, with these significant differences:<br><ul><li>a king is a separate type of piece, rather than being represented by a stack of 2 pieces.</li><li>rather
than remove captured pieces, the top piece of a captured stack is
placed under the capturing stack. &nbsp;If the captured stack is not
empty, it rejoins the game.<br></li></ul>Conseqently, there are always 12 pieces of each color in play. &nbsp;Because of the "no repeat capture" rule, &nbsp;interaction<br>between two stacks can be quite complex.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Full Rules:</span>
<ul><li>the board size is 8x8, initially with 12 men per side</li><li>men move forward diagonally. &nbsp;Men that move into the last row become kings by adding a second man to make a stack of 2.</li><li>men capture <span style="font-style: italic;">adjacent</span> men of the other color, forward or backward, by jumping if there is an empty landing square immediately after.</li><li>captures can be either forward or backward, and are mandatory as long as more captures are possible.</li><li>capturing
moves the top piece of the captured stack to the bottom of the
capturing stack. &nbsp;If the captured stack is not empty, it rejoins
the game.</li><li>a man capturing and landing on the king row is promoted to King immediately, and can continue capturing as a King</li><li>during
multiple captures, the captured pieces are treated as if&nbsp;still "on
the board" and , and it is not permitted to jump the same piece twice
or land in the space previously occupied by a captured piece.</li><li>kings "fly"; they move forward or backward and can skip empry spaces before and after a jumped piece.</li></ul><p style="font-weight: bold;">Conditions for a Draw:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Mutual agreement
of the players.&nbsp;</li><li>The same position occurs
three times</li><li>Both players have kings, and both players have made 25 king moves without captures or moving a man.</li><li>Both players have 3 or fewer pieces,&nbsp;and both players have made 16 king moves without captures or moving a man.</li></ul></body></html>
