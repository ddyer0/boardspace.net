<h4>Object of the Game</h4>
<p>Be the first to get one of your rabbits to the other side of
the board.
</p>
<h4>Material</h4>
<p>
Arimaa is designed so that it can easily be played using a standard
chess
set. To make the game easier to learn for someone who is not familiar
with chess, the chess pieces are substituted with well known animals.
The substitution is as follows: elephant for king, camel for queen,
horse for rook, dog for bishop, cat for knight and rabbit for pawn.
The elephant is the strongest followed by camel, horse, dog, cat and
rabbit.
Coins need to placed on squares c3, f3, c6 and f6 of the chess board
to mark these as special trap squares (explained later). </p>
<h4>Setup</h4>
<p>The
game starts with an empty board. The player with the gold pieces sets
them on
the first two rows closest to that player. There is no fixed starting
position
so the pieces may be placed in any arrangement. But it is suggested
that most
of the stronger pieces be placed in front of the weaker rabbits. Once
the gold
player has finished the silver player sets the pieces on the two
closest rows.
Again the pieces may be placed in any arrangement within the first two
rows.
</p>
<h4>Play</h4>
<p>The
players take turns moving their pieces with the gold player going
first. All
pieces move the same way: in orthogonal directions (like rooks in
chess) forward, backward, left and right. But the rabbits cannot move
backward (like pawns in chess). On each
turn a player can move the pieces a total of four steps. Moving one
piece from
its current square to the next adjacent square counts as one step. A
piece can
take multiple steps and also change directions after each step. The
steps may
be distributed among multiple pieces so that up to four pieces can be
moved. A player may pass some of the steps, but may not pass the whole
turn or make a move equivalent to passing the whole turn.
</p>
<p>The
stronger pieces can move opponent's weaker pieces. For example your dog
can move the opponent's cat or rabbit, but not the opponent's dog or
any other
piece that is stronger than it. The opponent's piece must be
orthogonally adjacent
to your piece and can be moved by either
pushing or pulling it. To push an opponent's piece with your stronger
piece,
first move the opponent's piece to one of the empty orthogonally
adjacent squares and then move
your piece into its place. To pull an opponent's piece with your
stronger piece,
first move your piece to one of the unoccupied adjacent squares and
then move the opponent's piece into the square that was just vacated.<!-- can rabbits be pushed/pulled back; this is mentioned in the flash tutorial, but Mike Amling noticed that it is not mentioned in the written rules -->
Although rabbits cannot move backwards on their own, they may be pushed
or pulled back. A push or pull requires two consecutive steps and must
be completed within the same turn. Any combination of pushing and
pulling can be
done in the same turn. However when your stronger piece is completing a
push it
cannot pull an opponent's weaker piece along with it.
</p>
<p>A
stronger piece can also freeze any opponent's piece that is weaker than
it. A
piece which is next to an opponent's stronger piece is considered to be
frozen
and cannot move on its own; though it can be pushed or pulled by
opponents
stronger pieces. However if there is a friendly piece next to it the
piece is
unfrozen and is free to move.
</p>
<p>There
are four distinctly marked traps squares on the board (c3, f3, c6 and
f6 in standard notation). Any piece that is on a
trap square is immediately removed from the game unless there is a
friendly
piece next to the trap square to keep it safe. Be careful not to lose
your own
pieces in the traps.
</p>
<h4>Special Situations</h4>
<p>A push or pull is considered atomic as if the two pieces are
moved simultaneously. Thus it is possible for the pulling piece to step
into a trap and be removed from the
game while completing the pull.
</p>
<p>A player may push or pull the opponent's rabbit into the
goal row it is trying to reach. If at the end of the turn the rabbit
remains there, the player loses. However if the opponent's rabbit is
moved back out of the goal row before the end of the turn, the player
does not lose.
</p>
<p>If
a player is unable to make a move because all the pieces are frozen or
have no
place to move, then that player has lost the game.
<!-- this was changed on 2005.05.28 so that the side to move is
considered and not just the position of the board.
The postion.pl file on the gameserver was edited.
To see the discussion which lead to this change search
for "repetition rule" in the Arimaa forum during 2004.
This was changed again on 2008.07.01 to make such moves
illeagle and eliminate lose by repetition.
--></p>
<p>If after a turn
the same board position and side to move would occur for the third
time,
then that move is illegal and the player must select a different
move. If in the rare case the only moves a player has are not allowed
then the player loses due to being unable to make a move.
<!--
<p>If after a turn
the same board position and side to move would be repeated three times, then that move is considered illegal and the player must select a different
move. If in the rare case the only moves a player has are not allowed then the player loses due to being unable to make a move.
--><!--
<p>If after a turn
the same board position and side to move is repeated three times, then the
player causing this to occur the 3<sup>rd</sup> time loses the game.
-->
<!--
Changed on 2008.07.01 - decided that Arimaa should be drawless
see: http://arimaa.com/arimaa/forum/cgi/YaBB.cgi?board=talk;action=display;num=1206399208
--></p>
<p>If a player loses all the rabbits then that player loses the
game. If in the rare case both players lose all rabbits on the same
move then the player
making the move wins the game.
<!--
<p>If
both players lose all the rabbits then the game is a draw.
Also see the 'Breaking Draws' section
of the <a href="matchRules.html">Match Rules</a> for more info.
--></p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The order of checking for win/lose conditions is as follows
assuming
player A just made the move and player B now needs to move:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if a rabbit of player A reached goal. If so player
A wins.
</li>
<li>Check if a rabbit of player B reached goal. If so player
B wins.
</li>
<li>Check if player B lost all rabbits. If so player A wins.
</li>
<li>Check if player A lost all rabbits. If so player B wins.
</li>
<li>Check if player B has no possible move (all pieces are
frozen or have no place to move). If so player A wins.
</li>
<li>Check if the only moves player B has are 3rd time
repetitions. If so player A wins.
</li>
</ol>
