				1: without time pressure</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif"><br/>
<br/>
Rules
				to learn the strategy of moving the hour-glasses without turning
				them over. Use them as normal pieces, not as hour-glasses. </font>
				</p>
				<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
				<font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">1.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Start: <br/>
Draw lots
				to determine who will play with the red hour-glasses. Red begins,
				then take turns moving your hour-glasses.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">2.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">A move: <br/>
Each turn
				you must move one of your hour-glasses. You may move it to any
				adjacent vacant space. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">3.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Dropping a ring: <br/>
After
				moving an hour-glass, you may play one ring: take a ring from
				your ringholder, put it over the hour-glass you moved and then
				drop it. (For the remainder of the game, the ring you dropped
				will serve as an indication that the space has been visited
				earlier on.) <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Note:</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				playing a ring is optional, but since getting rid of rings is the
				aim of the game, you should do it (or rather: don't forget to do
				it). If, for any particular reason, you decide not to play a ring
				and your opponent notices it, then he may play one of his rings
				where you didn't, and he may still make his regular move. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">4.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">The different
				spaces:<br/>
The spaces (tubes) on the board have different
				heights. Once the rings around a space are level with the height
				of the tube, that space may not be visited again for the
				remainder of the game.<br/>
&middot; 18 spaces around the edge of
				the board may only have 1 ring. <br/>
&middot; The next tier of
				12 spaces may have a maximum of 2 rings.<br/>
&middot; The inner
				tier of 6 spaces may have a maximum of 3 rings. <br/>
&middot;
				The central space may have 4 rings. <br/>
Note : you may never
				move an hour-glass to a space which already has its maximum
				number of rings. If you do, you lose the game at once. So, watch
				the rings on the board carefully.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">5.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Passing your turn:<br/>
When
				you cannot move any of your hour-glasses (because all three are
				blocked by your opponent's hour-glasses and/or spaces you may not
				move to any more), you must pass your turn. You must continue to
				pass until you are able to move again - or until the game
				ends.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">6.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				The end:<br/>
The game ends when no more moves can be made. The
				player with the fewest rings left wins the game. Most of the time
				this means that the first player who has to pass because he
				cannot move his hour-glasses any more, will lose. So, the aim is
				to get rid of rings, but it could also be said that the aim is to
				be the first to block all three of the opponent's hour-glasses.
				<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">7.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">A tie:<br/>
If both
				players have an equal number of rings left, the game ends in a
				tie.</font></p>
				<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
				<font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Level
				2 : with time pressure</font></font></p>
				<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
				<font face="Georgia, serif">The second level is played as
				described under Level 1, but with additional rules for the
				hour-glasses. The 15-second hour-glass is still left out of the
				game. The aim of this version is to get used to the time pressure
				caused by the pieces (i.e. the hour-glasses) and to see how it
				will influence your strategy. <br/>
<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Note:
				</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Level 1 is a game on
				itself, and so is level 3. Level 2 is an intermediate level; just
				play it a few times as an introduction to level 3. </font>
				</p>
				<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">1.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				Start:<br/>
The starting position remains the same.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">2.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">The first 3 turns:<br/>
You
				and your opponent are obliged to use your first 3 turns to move
				each of your 3 hour-glasses. When moving an hour-glass, it must
				be turned over. Thus, after you and your opponent have made 3
				moves each, the time of all 6 hour-glasses on the board will be
				running.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">3.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				A move:<br/>
You must try to keep your hour-glasses alive. Each
				time you move an hour-glass to a vacant adjacent space (in fact,
				while you are moving it), it must be turned over. In other words:
				each turn you must reverse the time of one of your hour-glasses.
				A move must be made with a fluid motion; you may not keep an
				hour-glass in a horizontal position. You must let go of the
				hour-glass as soon as it is moved, i.e. you may not prevent your
				opponent from starting his move by holding onto your moved
				hour-glass. (See point 5 below: Timing of a move.)<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">4.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Dropping a ring:<br/>
After
				moving an hour-glass, your turn is over, although you may still
				play a ring. But you must do it immediately and without
				hesitation after making your move. If you don't, you lose the
				opportunity to play a ring that turn. As described under Level 1,
				your opponent may put a ring where you didn't, before making his
				move.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">5.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				Timing of a move:<br/>
Immediately after you have moved one of
				your hour-glasses, your opponent may start his move. In other
				words, he does not need to wait until you have dropped your ring.
				But as soon as he moves an hour-glass, he may not play an extra
				ring if you didn't play one.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">6.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Losing an
				hour-glass:<br/>
When an hour-glass runs out of time, it is lost.
				A lost hour-glass remains on the board but may not be moved any
				more. <br/>
Note: you may lose an hour-glass on purpose! <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">7.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">15-second rule:<br/>
Even
				though you don't use the 15-second hour-glass, its principle is
				introduced as a &quot;gentlemen's agreement&quot;: the players
				have a maximum of 15 seconds to make their move. (Since it is a
				&quot;gentlemen's agreement&quot; only, there is no penalty when
				a player takes a bit more time than is strictly allowed. Just
				play quickly.) <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">8.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">The end:<br/>
The aim
				remains the same: getting rid of as many rings as possible. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">9.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				No more tie:<br/>
Unlike level 1, this level cannot end in a tie.
				If both players have an equal number of rings left, then time
				will determine the winner:<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>&middot;
				</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Remove the hour-glasses
				that have already run out of time from the board and put them
				aside.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>&middot;</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				Watch the remaining hour-glasses closely. Each hour-glass that
				runs out of time is to be taken from the board, and lined up in
				the order removed. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>&middot;</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">

				<font face="Georgia, serif">The complete game, played under

				<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">1.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				Start:<br/>
Red begins; black may decide whether the 15 second
				timer is to be placed to the left or right of the board. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">2.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				The 15-second rule: <br/>
The 15-second hour-glass is available
				to you during your opponent's turn, but you are not obliged to
				use it. You may use it (i.e. turn it over) if you want to force
				your opponent to make his move within 15 seconds. Of course, your
				opponent may use it too when it is your turn.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">3.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				The use:<br/>
To use the 15-second timer, simply turn it over,
				but you may only do so when the upper part is empty. So, on
				occasions you may have to wait until it runs out of time before
				you can use it against your opponent.<br/>
Note: when you have
				used the 15-second timer against your opponent, it is your turn
				again as soon as he made his move; you do not have to wait until
				the 15-second timer is empty. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">4.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				Private: <br/>
If you start your move but don't finish it in the
				allowed amount of time (i.e. when you don&rsquo;t let go of the
				hour-glass you moved before the 15-second timer runs out of
				time), you may complete the move, including dropping a ring, but
				you&rsquo;ll have to face a penalty. Your opponent may now drop
				</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>two</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				rings with his next turn. He starts his turn with his regular
				(i.e. he moves an hour-glass and puts a ring in the newly covered
				space), and next he may drop a second rings in any space on the
				board, no matter whether the space is occupied by an hour-glass
				(of either color) or not. Of course, it is only possible to drop
				a ring in a space that has not yet its maximum number of
				rings.<br/>
</font><b>Note:</b> this is an adjusted rule. The
				original rules said that you had the right to play twice when
				your opponent didn&rsquo;t finish his turn in time, but this
				could cause confusion in the ending stage of the game. That is
				fixed with this new rule. <font face="Georgia, serif"><br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">5.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Timing:<br/>
You may
				start your move as soon as your opponent releases the hour-glass
				he moved, or, if he hasn't finished his move yet, the moment the
				15-second timer runs out of time (i.e. in this case you must not
				wait until your opponent releases the hour-glass). <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">6.
				</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Passing a turn:<br/>
If
				you have not started to move an hour-glass when the 15-second
				timer runs out of time, you forfeit that turn. In other words:
				unlike in Level 1, you may now pass your turn, but the
				consequence is the same as when you have not finished your turn
				in time, as explained in point 4. above.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Note:</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				when you cannot make a move, this does not count as passing a
				turn. So, in this case the opponent may not drop 2 rings. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">7.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
				The end:<br/>
The game ends as described under level 1 and 2.</font>

</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">4.
</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Dropping a ring:<br/>
After
moving an hour-glass, your turn is over, although you may still play
a ring. But you must do it immediately and without hesitation after
making your move. If you don't, you lose the opportunity to play a
ring that turn. As described under Level 1, your opponent may put a
ring where you didn't, before making his move.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">5.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
Timing of a move:<br/>
Immediately after you have moved one of your
hour-glasses, your opponent may start his move. In other words, he
does not need to wait until you have dropped your ring. But as soon
as he moves an hour-glass, he may not play an extra ring if you
didn't play one.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">6.
</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Losing an hour-glass:<br/>
When
an hour-glass runs out of time, it is lost. A lost hour-glass remains
on the board but may not be moved any more. <br/>
Note: you may lose
an hour-glass on purpose! <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">7.
</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">15-second rule:<br/>
Even
though you don't use the 15-second hour-glass, its principle is
introduced as a &quot;gentlemen's agreement&quot;: the players have a
maximum of 15 seconds to make their move. (Since it is a &quot;gentlemen's
agreement&quot; only, there is no penalty when a player takes a bit
more time than is strictly allowed. Just play quickly.) <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">8.
</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">The end:<br/>
The aim
remains the same: getting rid of as many rings as possible. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">9.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
No more tie:<br/>
Unlike level 1, this level cannot end in a tie. If
both players have an equal number of rings left, then time will
determine the winner:<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>&middot;
</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Remove the hour-glasses that
have already run out of time from the board and put them aside.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>&middot;</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
Watch the remaining hour-glasses closely. Each hour-glass that runs
out of time is to be taken from the board, and lined up in the order
removed. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>&middot;</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
The player with the last &quot;living&quot; hour-glass on the board
wins the game. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>&middot;</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
In the rare case that the last hour-glass of both players run out of
time at exactly the same time, then the player who had the
last-but-one hour-glass on the board wins. </font>

<font face="Georgia, serif">The complete game, played under constant
time pressure caused by the hour-glasses and the 15-second timer. It
is played as described under Levels 1 and 2, but with additional
rules for the use of the 15-second hour-glass.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">1.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
Start:<br/>
Red begins; black may decide whether the 15 second timer
is to be placed to the left or right of the board. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">2.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
The 15-second rule: <br/>
The 15-second hour-glass is available to
you during your opponent's turn, but you are not obliged to use it.
You may use it (i.e. turn it over) if you want to force your opponent
to make his move within 15 seconds. Of course, your opponent may use
it too when it is your turn.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">3.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
The use:<br/>
To use the 15-second timer, simply turn it over, but
you may only do so when the upper part is empty. So, on occasions you
may have to wait until it runs out of time before you can use it
against your opponent.<br/>
Note: when you have used the 15-second
timer against your opponent, it is your turn again as soon as he made
his move; you do not have to wait until the 15-second timer is empty.
<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">4.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
Private: <br/>
If you start your move but don't finish it in the
allowed amount of time (i.e. when you don&rsquo;t let go of the
hour-glass you moved before the 15-second timer runs out of time),
you may complete the move, including dropping a ring, but you&rsquo;ll
have to face a penalty. Your opponent may now drop </font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>two</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
rings with his next turn. He starts his turn with his regular (i.e.
he moves an hour-glass and puts a ring in the newly covered space),
and next he may drop a second rings in any space on the board, no
matter whether the space is occupied by an hour-glass (of either
color) or not. Of course, it is only possible to drop a ring in a
space that has not yet its maximum number of rings.<br/>
</font><b>Note:</b>
this is an adjusted rule. The original rules said that you had the
right to play twice when your opponent didn&rsquo;t finish his turn
in time, but this could cause confusion in the ending stage of the
game. That is fixed with this new rule. <font face="Georgia, serif"><br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">5.
</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Timing:<br/>
You may start
your move as soon as your opponent releases the hour-glass he moved,
or, if he hasn't finished his move yet, the moment the 15-second
timer runs out of time (i.e. in this case you must not wait until
your opponent releases the hour-glass). <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">6.
</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">Passing a turn:<br/>
If you
have not started to move an hour-glass when the 15-second timer runs
out of time, you forfeit that turn. In other words: unlike in Level
1, you may now pass your turn, but the consequence is the same as
when you have not finished your turn in time, as explained in point
4. above.<br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Note:</b></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
when you cannot make a move, this does not count as passing a turn.
So, in this case the opponent may not drop 2 rings. <br/>
</font><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">7.</font></font><font face="Georgia, serif">
The end:<br/>
The game ends as described under level 1 and 2.</font>
