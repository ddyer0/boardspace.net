The "plus"
options are a set of mix and match options, presented at the
start of a game. &nbsp;All players must agree on the set of options
to be
used<br>
. &nbsp;When an option is changed, all the player checkmarks are
turned
off. &nbsp;The game starts when all players check ok<br>

<ul><li><h2>Select Green Cards from a market<br></h2><p>When you draw green cards,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> from the draw green card actions</span>, you also draw 2 extra &nbsp;cards which you can choose<br>instead,
and pay $1 for the benefit. &nbsp;If an oracle worker is in use, one
additional free choice will be available. &nbsp;Gaining<br>green cards from other sources (trace, stars, wakeup row, visitor cards) is unchanged.<br><br><img style="width: 713px; height: 401px;" alt="green market" src="greenmarket.jpg"></p></li><li></li><li><h2>Choose from 2 Mama and 2 Papa Cards<br></h2>Draw 2 mama and 2 papa cards at the beginning of the game, and select<br>one mama and one papa. &nbsp;This allows you to better plan a game with a<br>pair that work together.<br><img style="width: 757px; height: 430px;" alt="mamapapa market" src="mama-papa.jpg"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></li><li><h2>Unlimited Workers<br></h2>You can buy as many workers as you wish, but still only one of each type of special workers. &nbsp;<br>There's nothing magic about 6! &nbsp;Note that several cards that mention 6 workers will mean <span style="font-style: italic;">exactly 6. <br></span>And that various blue cards that let you train a worker can always be used.<br></li><li><h2>Continue Playing after Entering a Season<br></h2>This is probably the most radical of the options; &nbsp;when you pass to the next season, instead of waiting<br>there until all the other players also enter the season, you will take your turn in the new season in your<br>next normal turn. &nbsp;This is somewhat like the effect of the messenger special worker - if you get to a<br>seasone first, you get first choice of the placements. &nbsp;Several other consequences are not quite obvious.<br><ul><li>workers placed in the future by the "Planner" card will take their action in the next normal turn.<br>With continuous play, there is no such thing as "first in season"</li><li>"Merchant" special workers can earn a card bonus if they are the first and still only worker<br>in a new season.</li></ul></li><li><h2>Draw From Decks with Replacement<br></h2>Essentially, all the cards are drawn from the original full deck. &nbsp;So there can be duplicates, and (more important)<br>your odds of drawing a particular card is not changed if someone else has already drawn or played it.<br></li><li><h2>Limit per-player visitor cards to 3 VP and $6<br></h2>A few cards which offer a benefit in VP or $ for each opponent become extremely strong in 5 and 6 player games.<br>These cards are limited to a maximum benefit of $6 or 3VP. &nbsp;The affected cards are <br><img style="width: 1142px; height: 266px;" alt="cards" src="limited-cards.jpg"><br></li></ul>
