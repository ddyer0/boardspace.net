<font size=5>
Palago is a strategy game using only one type of tile and no board. The rules are very simple (first player to make a creature wins) but the strategy is surprisingly deep and there is no luck involved.
<BR><BR> Any number of tiles can be used to play, and this allows the possibility of handicapping the better player: ie if the tiles run out before one player has formed a creature, then the game is drawn and this can be considered a "handicap victory" for the lesser player. </font>

<font size="5"><b>Start the Game:</b></font>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> Choose a colour each (upside down tiles can be used
as a reminder) and draw a tile to see who starts. </li>
<li> The first player places two tiles in the middle with
both colours matching. </li>
<li> Players continue taking turns, always placing two
tiles per turn, and obeying the basic rules. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>The Basic Rules:</b></font>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> At least one of the two tiles must connect to the
palago (the tiles already played). </li>
<li> The two tiles being played must touch each other. </li>
<li> All touching edge colours must match. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>The Winner:</b></font>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> The first player with a closed creature of their
colour is the winner, except that eyes do not count. </li>
<li> The creature must be closed in the inside too. </li>
<li> Only one tile needs to be played, if that tile
results in a win for either player. </li>
<li> A player loses if they close creatures of both
colours on the same move. </li>
<li> Palago can be played with any number of tiles. The
game is drawn if the tiles run out before either player wins, although
with 48 tiles this is unlikely. </li>

<td><font size="5"> To summarize, Palago
is fascinatingly balanced between attacking and defending strategies.
In fact, early in the game it can be wiser to defend without
counter-attacking. This is because a player's overall position
deteriorates with each attack while defending often seems to improve
it. Then, when the timing is right, players should go on the attack and
try to convert their superior position into a win. </font></td>
