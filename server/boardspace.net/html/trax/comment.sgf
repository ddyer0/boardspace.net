;C[However, I ignore it and complete my loop.
One observation - in this game the only attack you made (10 D0/) turned out to be fatal. Although that is not always the case, in general attacking without good reason usually weakens your position (it uses up a corner - your attacking potential) and often gives your opponent potential (either directly as in this case, or in the defence). You will notice that although I made a couple of threats, I did not make an attack until I could see that it would be to my advantage. It this case, it was the start of a 4 stage win (moves 11, 13, 15, and 17).]

 quite quickly.]

 like this move. However, I never use it myself. Just personal

 the line is starting to become dangerous. Note that it was not 
 strictly necessary to extend my line out to prevent it from being 
 turned back. If I played somewhere else, and you linked it back, you 
 would lose as follows:
8 @2/ A0\\ any E1/ any win.
Your turning the line back would give me an edge (3 stage threat).]

 also defends my short edge and creates a short L for you

P0[move F 2 \\]
;C[I cap off your corners. This kills your L, creates an L for me,
and makes my line very dangerous.]
P1[move G 2 \\]
;C[A weak, and ineffective move. It does however kill the L, but does 
 nothing for the line - I can straighten my line out again and it is 
 one tile longer than before. The best defence of the line would have 
 been 13 A1\\ any @3+. This also runs the L out of space. Linking back 
 my line is now safe with the other end turned down(from move 11).]

;C[This is the start of an early line game. Although not dangerous at 
 this early stage, if left for too long, black can develop a very 
 strong line.]
P1[move @ 1 +]
;C[My standard response to such a position. This move doesn't actually 
 defend the line, but it allows me to defend it later.]
P0[move C 1 \\]
;C[As you can see, you can straighten out your line, making it one tile
 longer.]
P1[move C 2 \\]
;C[This position is known as Smith's opening, after David Smith who 
 first analysed it in any depth. It is strong for three reasons.
1) it kills the black corner, replacing it with a white corner. Black 
 now has no opportunities for making a direct attack.
2) It prevents the black line from being extended to the left. If 
 6 @1+, white responds with B3/ creating two attacks. Such a position 
 is called a pair L since the attack at the bottom of the L creates a 
 connectable pair.
3) It prevents the black line from being extended to the right. If

6 D2+ B0/ C4+ C5\\ D4\\ E4\\ any E1/ any win
                  D5\\ E6\\ any B6/ any win
          D4\\ E4\\ any E1/ any win
Note that the black line has not actually been defended - just 
 temporarily delayed.]
P0[move B 3 \\]
;C[This move extends the black line to the right, setting up the 5 stage 
 threat for white. More usual replies (if you want to keep the line 
 threat) are A3+, B4\\ or A0/.]
P1[move D 2 +]
;C[The way this threat works is that I attack into the hollow in the 
 bottom right corner. Attacking into such a hollow is generally 
 strong since the attack can only be defended downwards and to the 
 right. In this case, such defences set up an edge threat on the 
 right hand side for me.]
P0[move B 0 /]
;C[Of your two choices, this is the better since it makes me work for an 
 extra turn to get my win. In other words it gives me more chances to 
 change my mind or make a mistake.]

 defended to the right or downwards.]

;C[This game is starting out like the last game. It is a line game with 
 Black having a three long line.]
P1[move C 2 \\]
;C[White kills black's only corner, bringing out a parallel line. It 
 also makes his own line 3 long. However, it doesn't retain the 
 initiative, allowing black to extend the line. A much stronger move 
 is the single tile B3\\, giving Smith's opening (see previous 
 commentary)]
P0[move C 3 +]
;C[My line is extended to 4 tiles long. If we had a line race (with each 
 of us pushing our lines) I would win since I am one tile in front.]
P1[move D 2 +]
;C[White realises this and turns his own line back, giving a 4 stage 
 threat on the right.
E1/ any C6\\ D5\\ E5\\ any win
            D6\\ E6+ any win
It also prevents black from extending the line at either end.
If 8 A2+, B4/ any win
If 8 E3+, E4\\ any E1/ any win
In spite of these advantages, it is a dangerous move. I was tempted 
 to go for a win along the top, hoping you would make a mistake at 
 the crucial steps. My corner at B1\\ is very strong, facing into a 
 hollow. ie
B1\\ A1\\ E2+ D1/ A0\\ any E1/ any win
            E1/ A0\\ any F1+ any win
    A2+ A2\\ B1\\ F2+ E1/ B0\\ any E1/ any win
                    F1/ B0\\ any F1+ any win
            A1\\ F2+ F1/ F0+ any A1+ any win
                    E1/ ...
This last combination you have a counter-attack at each end of my 
 edge so I cannot force a win. I would have relied on you picking one 
 of the other 5 continuations for a win. My position at the end of 
 this is considerably weakened from all my attacking, so I decided 
 not to risk it.
A better move would be E1\\, even though it allows me to extend my 
 line further. It also allows you to turn the line back at the other 
 end. ie
E1\\ E0+ A4/ any @3+.]
P0[move B 0 /]
;C[Since I can't extend my line, I kill your threat. I do it in such a 
 way that it frees both ends of my line, making it very dangerous
]
P1[move B 5 \\]
;C[Not a particularly strong move - it allows me to straighten the line 
 making it one tile longer. I am not sure what your best move here 
 would have been. Your position is quite weak, with only the 1 corner 
 in the top left, so none of the obvious things work. I probably 
 would have done something like A5+, bringing out a parallel line. 
 However, as it stands, the black line cannot be turned back even 
 then since it would give an L.

 allowing the line to be turned back in move 13.]

P1[move D 0 +]
;C[Turning my line towards one of your corners slows it down 
 temporarily. However, since the line is so strong, there is little 
 else you can do. Turning it to the other corner (F3+) is no better.]
P0[move F 2 /]
;C[I make an attack, providing an extension to my line. This way I am 
 hoping to provide a connection to make my line 8 tiles long. Note 
 that I could not extend the line at the other end.

           any  H4\\ any win  with L]
P0[move G 4 \\]
;C[I defend your counter-attack forming an L (H6\\). You also have to 
 deal with this as well as the line, stretching your resources very 
 thin.]
P1[move G 5 \\]
;C[Defends the L and gives you a corner which you can use to turn the 
 line back. However it also loses the initiative, allowing me to win. 
 An unconventional defence such as F6/ would probably have served 
 better as it starts giving you somewhere to link the line to. Note 
 G6/ is fatal: it loses to A6/ any H2/ any win
with the bottom line.]

;C[I make the attack extending the line out.]
P1[move H 5 +]
;C[Your L does not provide enough distraction]
P0[move H 1 /]
;C[I win with the line.
Moves 5 and 7 are weak, and are probably what cost you the game. On their own, either of them was not that bad, but in combination they did little to slow me down, especially after my move 8 (which killed just about everything you had). Move 9 was also weak, but there was virtually nothing else you had. This was a hard game to comment on since your position was weak it was hard to find reasonable alternate moves. I have tried, where possible, to suggest better alternatives. With lines, it is very important to try to get them under control as early as possible.]

 putting one end of it into a hollow.]

 stronger since I gain nothing by linking your two segments. In terms 
 of corners I have the advantage: 3 corners + a connectable pair to 
 your 2. Overall it is still fairly even (with your line balancing my 
 extra loop threats), although I have a considerable advantage if I 
 can destroy your budding line threat.]

 making your line longer at the moment. I have also set up an L 
 threat (E1/).]

 (although it would still be strong vertically). (If 12 D1+ C0+). 
 The move you made was good in that it keeps your options open either 
 horizontally or vertically. It also destroys two of my corners 
 replacing them with your own. It also gives you an L (F4\\)]
P1[move F 2 \\]
;C[I was contemplating capping off again, giving myself an L, but 
 decided on the more subtle F4L. Capping off would have actually made 
 your line stronger since you could use the corner at the bottom of 
 your L for straightening it out. I have a 4 stage threat along the 
 top and right edges:
G4\\ any E1+ any G2/ any win]
P0[move F 4 /]
;C[This was the losing move. In what it does it is good - it kills my 
 corner, giving you an L. Just based on corners and lines you would 
 have a slight advantage. However, this move does not defend the 4 
 stage threat. A better move would have been G5/. This has the same 
 effect in terms of corners, it defuses my threat, and sets up a 2 
 stage cave threat for yourself (F5+ any win). This position is also 
 slightly stronger since I can't link the two corners.]

 threats (this is where it gets complicated):
  D4\\ any D1/ any win
  A4/ any win
  @2/ any D0/ any A1\\ any win
  white must therefore attack, since all three threats cannot be 
  defended at once. The only attack that is of any use is 7 @1\\ A0\\. 
  Again, although this move is not an attack, black still has 2 
   threats:
    E5\\ any E2/ any win
    D1/ any win
    If these are both defended, with 9 C1+, D1\\, E2\\ or E3+ then

      @1\\ any A5\\ or
              A6+ any A8/ any win
      If necessary (because of lines) this second threat may be 
      split further with @5+ giving two Ls (A1\\ and A7/). If white 
      played 9 E3+ giving two horizontal line threats, black can use 
      H3\\ also to defend the line while creating a further threat for 
      black F1+ any H2/ any win
    For move 9 then, white may be better to attack. if
    A4/ @3+ creating a further L and white is done for
    E2+ D1/ any E6\\ any win
    A3/ A4/ creates a further threat for black:
      @1\\ any A6/ any E5/ any win
      white's only defence now is to try for the line with 11 F3+.
      Black responds with G3\\, defending the line, giving a 3 stage 
      threat (E1+ any G2/ any win)
      The only move 13 white has to destroy the two threats is B0\\, 
      to which black responds with D2+, giving 3 further threats:
        F1/ any win
        G2/ any win
        G5+ @3+ A6/ any E5/ any win
        white cannot defend all these - and must attack.
        Both attacks (A0\\ and A0/) can be counter-attacked with the 
        black line. ie Black wins.

 also have a 3 stage threat (an edge):
@4/ any A1\\ any win
Note, how in making your attack, the position changed from being to 
 your advantage to being to my advantage. You have 2 corners and I 
 have 4 now. My defence has given you the start of a horizontal line 
 threat too, although it is protected at the right by my corner (you 
 can't straighten it out without giving me an attack).
A better move 6 for you would have been D2S, defending my threat, 
 killing one of my corners, giving you a connectable pair, and a 
 threat:
C0/ D2+ E2/ E1/ F1/ any F4\\ any win
            D1/ A2+ B1\\ E0/ any B1\\ any win
                    A1\\ E0/ any A1+ any win
    D1/ A2+ B1\\ E0/ any B1\\ any win
            A1\\ E0/ any A1+ any win]
P0[move B 4 +]
;C[Again, note how your attack uses up one of your corners and gives 
 one to me. A better move would have been B1S, which defends my 
 threat without using up corners. In fact it gives you another 
 corner, and also enhances your vertical line prospects.]
P1[move A 0 +]
;C[Again, my defence gains me a corner, and a threat (A5/). You still 
 have 2 corners, and I now have 6. Your horizontal line is a little 
 stronger though.]
P0[move @ 1 \\]
;C[Brings your line out while killing my L. Your line has the option of 
 going either vertically or horizontally. I too have a growing 
 horizontal line which can also be made vertically.]
P1[move A 4 +]
;C[This move serves two purposes. It provides an extra stop to your 
 horizontal line, since it is now blocked by the corner at E3 as 
 well. It also makes my line threat a little more serious especially 
 since I have a corner at the top. ie
@1\\ A0\\ A1\\ any win
    any C7\\ any win]
P0[move F 4 +]
;C[Defends my line by turning it back. In doing so, you have removed 
 one of the blocks on your line, making it much stronger. It also 
 gives you an L (A6/ any win)]
P1[move C 6 \\]
;C[I defend your L, creating an edge (@6/ any A1\\ any win). My vertical 
 line is also getting stronger too.]
P0[move B 6 +]
;C[Defends both the edge and the vertical line threat, while making your 
 line longer. Your line is still blocked at the other end though. 
 However, this move is faulty since it creates a new 4 stage threat 
 for me:
C7/ any D8\\ E7+ F7\\ any win
            E8\\ F8+ any win
A better move would have been B0/ which defends the edge, places a 
 block on my vertical line, and gives you an L.]

 only time that I use this opening, I am working towards a trap

 alternative move (discovered by the computer program several years

 forms a threat for you (C3\\ any win).]

 corners, gives you an L, and keeps your line possibilities alive. In 
 other words, it keeps most of your options open.]
P1[move D 0 \\]

 with my own) and this (which extends my line). The line is harder to

@3\\ E6\\ F6\\ G5\\ leaves you with 3 threats! Although I would have the

 have my line there.
@4/ is definitely the safer move.]

 you would have been better working on that. D6\\ turns my line

 possibilities if I attack downwards. (I contemplated this, but

 the line threat is pushed. The top line is blocked with E2/, and the

P0[move F 2 /]
;C[Because of your connectable pairs, there is very little I can safely 
 play over on the right hand half of the playing area. I also want to 
 try and weaken your position if I possibly can. This seemed the best 
 I could come up with even though it makes a cave with your 
 connectable pairs coming in.]
P1[move F 3 +]
;C[You thoroughly mess up my position, and create a cave at the other 
 end of your connectable pairs. On their own they are reasonably safe 
 - I just can't touch them.]
P0[move F 1 \\]

 This reduces the possibility of you using them to make the cave 
 work. My line is starting to get stronger again.]
P1[move G 1 \\]
;C[Here I can see that you are trying to form a third connectable pair, 
 making the whole lot very strong. You also form a threat:
C1/ D3\\ E0/ any win
    D4\\ B0\\ any E1/ any win  or
D4+ E1+ B0\\ any E1/R any win ]
P0[move F 4 /]
;C[The only way I can defuse these two threats is to play something at 
 the top. I chose this move because it prevents you making the third 
 connectable pair, and also makes my corner at G2 stronger by making 
 a hollow.
Note that in my last 2 moves I have recovered my position somewhat by 
 regaining a few corners.]
P1[move F 0 /]
;C[This attack throws away all your advantage. There is nothing you can 
 do with the connectable pairs yet. You are better leaving them for 
 later when they may become useful. As it was, I could not play in 
 the cave at the bottom, and my moves were limited in the cave at the 
 top - both caves were to your advantage. This move effectively fills 
 both caves. You gain no corners, lose your connectable pairs, and 
 free up a significant part of the playing area that was closed off 
 to me. You not only lose the advantage, but help my line as well. 
 Moves like F0/, F6/ or @4\\ would have been better.]
P0[move E 5 /]
;C[I play the defence leaving you with the least. All you have left from 
 the caves is three line threats, of which the outside two are 
 weaker.]
P1[move D 2 \\]
;C[I can see that you are trying to make your centre line stronger, but 
 it is just a little too short to get there.
It also weakens my line considerable. I think these two 
 considerations, plus the fact that it throws out another corner to 
 replace the one you are using, make this move reasonable.
]
P0[move B 1 \\]
;C[I play this move so that if you make the attack with C0/ I have 
 something to turn your line back (yes I would need to be very 
 careful not to give you a threat into the cave I have formed on the 
 left), and it prevents you from gaining a further corner.]
P1[move A 1 \\]
;C[You kill an important corner of mine, while creating an L for 
 yourself (G6\\ any win). It also strengthens both your centre line 
 and right hand line.]
P0[move E 6 +]
;C[It was tempting to link your corners and get a strong line across the 
 bottom. However, it would be too easy to link back. Instead I 
 decided to kill the corner, lengthening my top line. Your right hand 
 line is still blocked at the top so I figured I would be safe 
 leaving it for another turn or so.]
P1[move H 3 +]
;C[This appears to kill an important corner of mine, and makes both your 
 vertical lines quite strong. However, it was actually the break I 
 was looking for. I saw how I could use this to get my line home 
 across the top:]
P0[move F 0 /]
;C[First I needed to reform the corner which I would use later. None 
 of your defences make any difference.]
P1[move G 1 /]
;P0[move H 1 +]
;C[I also need to extend the playing area on the left so I can get my 
 line out while making an attack. Again, there is nothing you can do.]
P1[move @ 5 /]
;P0[move B 7 /]
;C[I bring the left hand end of my line out to the edge, while making an 
 attack. Again, you can do nothing.]
P1[move A 4 +]
;P0[move A 2 \\]
;C[Finally, I make an attack to bring the two segments of the line 
 within joining range. I had to make this attack last since in 
 defending you could threaten with your vertical line.]
P1[move F 1 +]
;C[Again - you played well. It was only two weak moves which didn't help you.
You had quite an advantage until your move 15. The losing move at 21 was understandable - my win was not particularly obvious. Against most players it would have been a reasonable move.]

This move does not prevent black from making the line longer at the
 other end though. A better move would have been B0/ (Smith's 
 opening) since this stops either end of the line from being
 extended: If 5 B0/ D2+,
B4\\ D1/ E4\\ any E1/ any win

 still cannot extend the line to the left.]
P1[move F 2 \\]

 an attack. Black must defend the attack allowing white to retain the
 initiative to link the line back.]

P0[move @ 3 +]
;C[Black makes an attack into the hollow on the top. This would normally 
 be a good move, but the corner at B1 is just one tile too far away. 
 If it was closer (at C1 instead) this would result in:
H3\\ F2/ F1/ any win
    G2/ G1+ any win
    H2+ F1/ any I3/ any I6\\ any win]
P1[move H 3 \\]
;C[This is the strongest defence. The others actually lose!
If F2/ F1/ any B0/ any win
If G2/ B0/ any G2+ any win
Note that white also has two threats:
H6+ any F1+ any win
This one has been there for a while but would not have worked until 
 now. Black could have made the line longer or counter-attacked the 
 first attack. The second threat is similar, although a little more 
 subtle:
F1+ E6+ H6+ any win
    F6\\ C6/ any @2/ any win
White also has good vertical line prospects with 3 parallel vertical 
 lines (the odd number negates the effect of linking the lines back 
 since they can then be linked again at the other end giving a single 
 line).]
P0[move H 2 +]
;C[This attack defends the second of the two threats. Any defence will 
 also extending the playing area, reducing slightly the threat of the 
 vertical white lines.]
P1[move @ 1 \\]
;C[A strong move. It defends the attack and also kills the useful Black 
 corner. More importantly it sets up another threat for white in the 
 top left corner:

    A2+ @2\\ B1\\ B0\\ any D1/ any win
            A1\\ @1\\ A0\\ E1/ any win

        F0+ D0\\ any A4\\ any win
        any A3\\ any win
(You were not expected to see all that - being 11 stages long). This 
 puts Black on the back foot since the two threats are independent, 
 and cannot both be destroyed simultaneously.]
P0[move B 0 /]
;C[This kills the cave threat, but leaves the 11 stage threat.]
P1[move G 7 \\]
;C[White takes the pressure off the black line threat across the top - 
 it now takes an extra turn or two to push home, giving white more 
 room to move. It also sets up a white L (A4/). It destroys the 11 
 stage threat however.]
P0[move @ 2 +]
;C[Although this kills the L, it is faulty. White can cap off again,
 reforming the L on the bottom and a cave L on the top (A1\\ any C0/ 
 any win). It also gives white a 3 stage threat: F7/ any F1/ any win.
The only safe defence Black could have made was C6+- very 
 unconventional.]

 do need to keep my black line in mind.]
P1[move B 1 +]
;P0[move C 1 \\]
;C[This is part of a standard opening. The line is turned slightly then 
 restraightened. Note here that just turning an end of the line does 
 not actually stop it. In fact it actually helps it grow longer.]
P1[move C 2 \\]
;C[This looks like an attempt to bring out a parallel line to turn the 
 black line back. The basic idea is right, but you lose the 
 initiative, allowing me to extend my line. It is also extending your 
 white line to 3 long. However since I have the initiative, I would 
 win any line race (if we both push our lines) since I am one turn 
 ahead. The standard move here is 5 B3\\, giving Smith's opening 
 (named after David Smith, the inventor of the game who came up with 
 this position). In Smith's opening, the Black line cannot be 
 extended at either end without giving white a winning position.]
P0[move C 3 +]
;C[I push my line. We are now well and truly into a line game. My line 
 is quite dangerous at this point.]
P1[move D 2 +]
;P0[move E 1 \\]
;C[This third attempt to stop the line is also ineffective since it does 
 not actually defend the line. Linking to a parallel line only works 
 if it cannot be straightened again, as here. My line is now 5 long, 
 and becoming serious.]
P1[move E 0 +]
;C[I am not sure of the purpose of this move. I think it might be to 
 make an attack while extending your line to 4. You can then play 
 making your line 5. However I would still be ahead in such a line 
 race even if my defence didn't make my line 6 long. This is the move 
 which lost you the game.]
P0[move E 4 \\]
;C[I extend my line while defending your attack. Notice also the long 
 edge starting to form along the top. If I extend my line further, it 
 will give me an edge across the top.]
P1[move F 2 \\]
;C[This is the best way to defend the line - making an attack while 
 bringing out a parallel line. If this was played at move 9, you 
 would have been ok.]
P0[move A 4 /]
;C[Knowing that you will turn my line back (you have to, my line is 
 critical), I look to see what I can then do. I want to give myself 
 a corner to make a potential L. This is the main thing you have to 
 look out for when linking back a line - that it doesn't make an 
 attack for the other person, or that they can't use it to make a 
 threat of some sort.]
P1[move B 5 \\]
;P0[move @ 3 +]
;C[You turn my line back, and I form my two threats. Note that if your 
 line didn't get in the way I could force the whole thing:
14 F5\\ any H2\\ any H0/ any D1\\ any win
except if you defend the first attack right (F6+) your line becomes 7 
 long and you win. Instead, I had to settle for two threats by 
 playing the H2\\ first.]

 fell into in your first game. ie
A0/ @2/ any D0/ any A1\\ any win  or
@1/ B0/ any D0/ any A1\\ any win.
Because the position is symmetrical, B2\\ and D1/ lose similarly.]
P0[move C 1 /]

 This is a safe reply]
P1[move A 2 /]
;C[I push my line, and create an L (C3\\)]
P0[move A 3 +]
;C[You defend the L, bringing your line out to 3 long as well. The 
 position is symmetrical, and there is nothing much there, although 
 I have a slight advantage since it is my turn. Note that we both 
 have potential edges if the lines are turned back. eg @2/ turning
 your line back gives you an edge (D0/ any A1\\)]
P1[move C 2 +]
;C[I push my line. In a line race, I would win because I am one step 
 ahead. However, you do have a corner poised ready to turn my line 
 back with C4\\ any B5+. Before you can do this, you must prevent me 
 from being able to turn my line into some loop threat.]
P0[move A 4 +]
;C[This looks like the best way of doing just that]
P1[move A 0 /]
;C[Here I had a couple of choices. I could have turned my line back 
 creating an edge across the top, or push my line. I decide to push 
 my line because you need practise on line defence. Besides the edge 
 is too obvious and although I also get a 4 stage threat down the 
 left, both threats can be destroyed by killing the top left corner. 
 ie if 9 @3+ I set up
11 D0/ any A1\\ any win          and
11 B6/ A5/ A0\\ any A6\\ any win
       A6/ A0\\ any A7+ any win
however both threats can be destroyed with A0/ or @1/ or similar]
P0[move @ 1 +]
;C[Even though I am pushing my line and it is now 5 long, I cannot 
 actually make it any longer at the moment. You have stops at both 
 ends. A0+ or B0/ to extend the top both give you attacks, and B6+ at 
 the bottom gives you an L threat (D5\\). Although the line looks 
 dangerous, you are actually better off leaving it at this stage. 
 Your best move at this stage is probably @3\\. This prevents me from 
 making an attack there freeing up the line (@3/ any C0/). It also 
 prevents me from freeing up the other end with E3\\ (giving me a 
 threat F3\\ any F1/ any win) since after A3\\, F3\\ (was E3\\) gives you 
 an L (A4/).
I can see what you are wanting to do though - D5\\ brings out a 
 parallel line while retaining the initiative for turning the line 
 back.]

 turning the line back, and want to improve any possibilities I have 
 for when you do.]

 have given up there and tried to set up something else - everything 
 seems to be just too far apart. However, I have a flash of 
 inspiration and believe I can use what you have given me, so]

 Better moves would have been B0/, @3/ (watch out for the line) B5/

 attacking potential. With so many Black corners, you have to be very 
 careful not to inadvertently leave any threats.]

    with the passive move in (1) you do not have any corners that you 
    can use to attack that lets you defuse both threats. You can
    delay a quite a few turns but nothing serious.

D3+ any E5\\ any E1/ any win]
P1[move C 4 /]
;C[Since I must leave those corners, I try to turn them to my advantage. 
 Two corners side by side form the central part of an edge threat. By 
 setting up a way of putting my own corners on the ends, I can build 
 the edge. D1/ gives me a corner at D4, so all I need now is 
 something to give me the corner at A4. A0\\ is such a move. Although 
 it gives you a counter-attack to my D1/ (now D2/) , it considerably 
 limits your safe moves in the lower half of the board.]
P0[move A 0 \\]
;C[A reasonable reply. It defuses an important corner, and threatens 
 with your line (using the corner I gave you last turn). I can still 
 form the corner at A4 by playing A3/ but it doesn't help me since 
 you still have a counter-attack on the other side.]
P1[move @ 1 \\]
;C[This turn deals with all of these. It reforms the corner on the top 
 left (as a connectable pair), prevents you from using your corner to 
 straighten your line, and takes away your counter- attack. My threat 
 around the bottom now works as follows:
E3/ any B5+ any F7\\ any C7/ any win]
P0[move A 0 \\]
;C[When I saw this reply, I thought "oh no, he has found a way to get 
 his line home". Fortunately though, you didn't. As a result, this 
 move is actually quite weak. True, it does make your line stronger, 
 but it also makes my line stronger as well. It does nothing to 
 defuse my threat since my reply simply reforms it. 
Another move that may have been better is E5\\ which kills my threat, 
 and extends your lines without extending mine. It also makes the 
 corner at D6 quite strong.
Another possibility is D7+, which defuses my threat and sets up a 
 couple of possibilities for you on the right hand side.]
P1[move E 6 \\]
;C[I was tossing up between this and C7\\ which forms the L directly. I 
 decided this move was better since my threat still works, and it 
 prevents you from turning my line back on the right hand side. If 
 you play F5+, I win with
G7\\ any G3/ any win]
P0[move E 7 \\]
;C[Good move. It kills my critical corner and enables you to turn my 
 line back if you wish. That corner is strong for you now since if I 
 try to kill it, I give you a threat.
If E9\\, C7/ any win
If D7+, E9\\ any C9/ any win]
P1[move E 8 \\]
;C[I am also concerned about your horizontal line which is 
 strengthening. All I wanted to do with my line helped both your line 
 across the top and your line across the middle. I decided to play 
 defensively and link the two lines while it was still safe to.]
P0[move F 4 +]
;C[As my move made my line stronger, your defence here was quite 
 expected.]
P1[move G 4 \\]
;C[It is interesting how line threats migrate. Of concern to me now is 
 your line threat across the bottom (between D6 and G5) so I decided 
 to turn that one back too. It was then that I realised that I have a 
 very strong position. I have an L which you need to deal with, and 
 my line threat across the bottom looks good.]
P0[move H 4 \\]
;C[I do not see any attacks which are worth you making, so you must 
 defuse the L.
If I4\\, J8\\ any H3+ any J3/ any win
Other defences lose to
   H9+ I9\\ I10\\ any F10/ any win
       I8/ J8/ any J10\\ any F10/ any win
       I8\\ or
       I6+ F10/ E9+ D9/ any win
                E10/ D10+ any win
       I7/ F10/ E9+ G11\\ any E11/ any win
                E10/ D10+ any B9/ any win
However, this last line would be upset if you defended the L with D2/
 since it would make the final L faulty. Therefore D2/ was your only 
 possible defence. It also sets up a threat for you with
F1/ any B0+ any win
It is hard to say what would have happened if you had played the D2/. 
 I cannot see any way that I can force my line home. Everything that 
 I try seems to bring up more threats for you, so I would probably 
 have defended your threat rather than try to push the line.]

 later. It also prevents you from gaining another corner if you play 
 H8/.]
P1[move G 1 0 \\]

 back into play. The only other moves that had any possibility are 
 G7/ and G6/, but both leave you severely disadvantaged (I did not

;C[I nearly played H3\\, but I then saw the trouble with your lines and 
 edge when you respond with I3\\.

 gives you a connectable pair. I decided that your connectable pair 
 could get in my way later so decided to forgo the extra corner.]
P1[move H 8 \\]
;C[This move was expected - it blocks my line and defuses the 5 stage 
 threat in the top left corner. However, I think @4/ might have been 
 better since it doesn't allow my next move.]
P0[move @ 5 +]

 use to push my line vertically, and it is still only 2 away 
 horizontally. I also use it to threaten with a loop:
A9+ any J5+ any win]
P1[move A 6 /]
;C[My line gives you problems here. This move was not unexpected since 
 it counter-threats with
I2/ any I7+ any win
However, I think J8\\ is stronger since it kills my corner more 
 thoroughly and still gives you a corner.]
P0[move J 8 +]
;C[I now commit my line vertically and threaten with:
A9+ any J1/ any win   and
J2/ any J5+ any win]

;C[This was perhaps your only defence to the threat / line combination.
 However, I think I can convert my line back into a loop!]

 with your vertical lines (the one in the centre and the one on the 
 right being resurrected later). This is my first direct attack of 
 the game.]

 in case I run out of steam before completing my win.]

 the position vertically: the direction of the white lines. It also 
 provides a partial defence for the horizontal line along the top by 
 providing a parallel segment to turn it back to if necessary.]
P0[move D 2 /]
;C[Similarly, this move kills a white corner, creates a black one and 
 strengthens blacks aspect ratio advantage. It also threatens a new 
 line across the bottom. Another good move is the one you played 
 against me in our first game (in the tournament) @1\\ which is better 
 from a junk path control standpoint, but does create a corner for 
 white. I don't know which of the two is better. The @1\\ also gives a 
 threat, and strengthens the line across the bottom.]
P1[move E 1 +]
;C[This move makes sense, as it creates a corner for you and prevents me 
 from turning my long path into a corner.  It also makes it difficult 
 for me to turn that path into a line threat as A2/ makes a cave for 
 you. I am a bit suspicious of @1/ though, because it makes the 
 aspect ratio very unfavourable for you, and doesn't kill an actual
 corner.
>>I defend your growing line threats by blocking the bottom line. 
 Although the aspect ratio is to your advantage, your lines are made 
 weaker by this move.<<
However they can become a dangerous connectable pair.]
P0[move @ 1 /]
;C[Move 8 mirrors move seven in that it creates a corner and starts the 
 process of turning my longest path into something useful. My plan is 
 to construct a connectable pair. Like move seven move eight also 
 extends the position in a direction favourable to the movers' 
 opponent, but with a width of six, I am not looking to extend the 
 position in the horizontal direction any further, so I have to start 
 taking advantage of the aspect ratio to make lines.]
P1[move E 0 +]
;C[Good move in all respects. It kills a corner, improves your 
 connectable pair by making it attack into a hollow, creates a white 
 corner and reduces somewhat my aspect ratio advantage. I am now 
 concerned that you can play B1/ B0\\ A5+ @1\\ B0/ threatening a cave 
 win with E3/ and an 11 stage in the upper right.]
P0[move C 0 /]
;C[This disrupts the connectable pair that could attack into hollows on 
 both ends and that was a threat to become a cave win. It also makes 
 possible A4/, straightening out the line or F2+, establishing the 
 connectable pair.]
P1[move D 4 +]
;C[You turn the line around completely while creating another corner, 
 taking advantage of the fact that I, by playing D4+ rather than D3+, 
 allowed you to loop the line around without creating a black corner. 
 This does raise the possibility of a cave threat by me however.
>>I didn't like the cave, but your line was getting too strong 
 again.<<
So I wind up getting some benefit from the weakened line.]
P0[move A 4 \\]
;C[I convert a junk path into a corner. I also create another black 
 corner and kill a white corner. The cave at the bottom of the 
 position can now only be a black cave threat. I actually have an 
 immediate threat to use the cave:
C0+ E2+ F2/ any G3\\ any win
    D1/ D0/ E1/ F1+ any G5+ any win
            E2/ F2/ any G4+ any win

            E2+ F2/ any G3\\ any win]
P1[move B 1 +]
;C[You likewise prevents me from using the cave, while creating two 
 white corners.
>>This move is reasonably weak. I was too concerned by your cave 
 possibility. I hadn't looked far enough to see that your move 14 
 puts me in trouble with your line. Perhaps something like C0\\ would 
 have been better. I can try to keep the pressure on with G4/. The 
 position becomes unclear then.<<
>>I don't like C0\\ - it seems to do more for you than for me. Maybe 
 something like D5+ would have been better, although that is playing 
 with fire.<<]
P0[move G 3 \\]
;C[I do some junk path control, making a short flat corner and 
 resurrecting my line threat. Although this line isn't very long, it 
 can grow to length seven in two moves.  I believe that this line 
 threat is stronger than any of your lines, and that this is possible 
 because the aspect ratio of the game is in my favour. I threaten:
E5+ C5/ A5/ any A2\\ any win
    D5/ D6/ any G6\\ any win]
P1[move B 4 \\]
;C[You cannot attach the short flat loop to the line without making an 
 edge for me, so naturally you kill the loop a different way.
>>This is only 1 of 2 safe defences. Even if I kill the corner at A2,
 you can win with the extended edge along the bottom:
eg @2/ F5+ E5/ H6\\ any E6/ any win
           D4/ H6\\ any A6/ any E6+ any win
If I defuse your flat corner to the right eg G5\\ B5+ gives an edge 
 and an attack. This leaves only D5/ or C5+, or attacking (which is 
 useless since all my attacks would be too far away to do anything 
 about your threat.<<]
P0[move D 5 /]
;C[Here I came up with a plan to bring my line around so that it would 
 become part of a connectable pair with the former short flat loop. 
 I felt if I could do this, I would have a good position as the 
 connectable pair could threaten to win with the corner sitting in 
 the middle of it. The outer loop of the connectable pair would also 
 still be a strong line threat. This first move of the plan threatens 
H2/ any F5+ any H5\\ any win.]
P1[move G 2 \\]
;C[This defence was expected as it kills the above threat and turns the 
 line to the side.
>>Again my move was forced. only H2\\ and H3+ survive.
D6/ loses to E5+ any G6\\ any win
G1\\ to H2+ giving a line attack, edge on top and a 3 stage on bottom 
 right. I can't counterattack so you would win.<<]
P0[move H 2 \\]
;C[This move brings the line around the corner while threatening
D0+ any H1/ any win.]
P1[move G 1 \\]
;C[This does defend the above threat, but looking at the position again, 
 I see that F0/ threatening B6+ is better. Your horizontal line 
 threat would prevent me from completing my plan and I am not sure 
 that my position is any better.
>>I think you are right. I didn't like it because it seemed to give 
 you too much up the top. Looking further I can't see anything wrong 
 with it. I had been planning for a while to play@4/ giving an L 
 (A2\\) and a cave (I1+ any C6+ any win) but it is passive and needed 
 the initiative.<<
Perhaps my idea at move 16 was too ambitious.
>>Maybe, but you got it too work, and that is the main thing.<<
Yes, but I was fortunate that I didn't lose my advantage as a result 
 of that plan.
>>That's what went wrong with my plan at move 19. I had a tenuous 
 threat which I was wanting the initiative to bring into play. You 
 had the advantage of initiative - I spend most of the latter part of 
 the game (basically from here (move 13) on) responding.<<]
P0[move D 0 /]
;C[I have gotten the position that I was looking for. I believe that the 
 defence for you is very difficult if not impossible from here. I 
 have both loop and line threats here with
G6+ any win
H6\\ any win
B6\\ any @3\\ any A6/ any win
>>Ouch! I had not anticipated this.<<]
P1[move H 5 +]
;C[The best move I can see.  This counters all of the above wins and 
 threatens a cave win with I4\\ any win.
>>My only move.<<]
P0[move G 6 /]
;C[I kill the cave and setup an L.
>>I was expecting either this or I4/.<<]
P1[move I 5 \\]
;C[This seems like a reasonable defence; I don't know if there is 
 anything better. It is now hard for either of us to get a horizontal 
 line.
>>In hindsight, G1+, H1\\ or I2\\ may have been better. I would have 
 been safer from your line, allowing me to use B6/ on move 25.<<
If you play any of these I can reply:
F6+ D7/ I7\\ any C6+ any win
    E7\\ A6+ any win
    D7+ B6\\ any A7/ any win
    E7+ B6\\ any @3\\ any A6/ any win
>>I didn't see these. Better for D7+ is F7\\ any win.<<
>>That means J5\\ is the only defence (if it can be called that). None 
 of my attacks work. The most promising is H1+, but you counter with 
 I2/. Any defence I make gives you a win (some quite long). That 
 means my move 19 was the losing move.<<]
P0[move J 5 \\]
;C[I concede that the horizontal line isn't happening and reform the 
 connectable pair. I threaten F6+ and B6\\ analogous to move 20 and I 
 also have a threat of I3+ forming an edge and a length six vertical 
 line. Also your vertical line along the left/middle of the game will
 have more trouble because I extended the position down one square.
I again don't know what you could have done at this point. Here are 
 some sample variations from one possibility at move 25 that doesn't 
 work:
B6/ I3+ @5/ A6/ @6/ C7\\ B8+ F0\\ E1\\ C1+ any H7+ any win
        J8/ F6+ C7\\ F8\\ F9\\ K4/ any K9\\ any win
                E7+ E8/ D8+ F9\\ any K4/ any K8+ any win
                        D8/ D1\\ C1\\ A1+ any L5/ any I9+ any L9+
Most other attempts for move 25 fail similarly.
>>B6/ is the only move that defends your nasty threat. I was just 
 about to play it when I realised that I was also in trouble with 
 your vertical line on the right hand side. This meant I was forced 
 to attack. I looked at many other variations on your possibilities 
 above, but I was always one turn behind. It was at this stage that I 
 realised that I had lost the game if you played right.<<
I believe A6+ also does, but fails in the same way as B6/. I had 
 thought that there was at least one other, but I can't find it 
 again.]
P1[move G 7 /]
;C[You choose instead to attack.]
P0[move I 2 +]
;C[Your attack has some bite, as this is the only safe reply for me. I 
 now can play G0\\ any I1/ any win in addition to my other threats so 
 you must continue to attack.]
P1[move H 1 /]
;C[This attack also creates a threat of F1\\ any @6/ any A4\\ any win. I 
 must now defend with a counterattack and we are in a struggle for 
 the initiative.
>>Since you have multiple threats and I have nothing, it is not so 
 much a struggle for the initiative, but holding on patiently making 
 sure you don't give me anything while I exhaust all my reasonable 
 Attacks. The sequence I chose was not necessarily the longest but 
 the one which gave you the most room for making mistakes. 
 Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on whose perspective you 
 take) that was not to be.<<]
P0[move H 0 /]

P1[move I 1 /]
;C[You also counterattack.]
P0[move J 2 /]

E8\\ any B8/ any win   (counterattack at F8\\)

 a strong position.]

                  initiative.]
P0[move F 8 \\]
;C[You play the counterattack, forming an L in the bottom right. My only 
 reply here is H5\\. At this stage I have two independent threats. The 
 threat on bottom left (explained in move 23) and an edge type threat 
 on the right:
I5\\ G2/ J2/ any J8+ any win
    any J8+ any J3+ any win
Note for the threat on the bottom left I would have to play F11+ 
 first to avoid losing to your line.
I am not sure what your best attack should be (you must attack since 
 I have two independent threats). Your line (C11\\) is probably the 
 best bet since it kills one threat while retaining the initiative. 
 B10/ seems to be the most reasonable reply to me after that.
If you try to use your corner at F12S to push your line, I win.
You would probably then kill my other threat probably with something 
 like I4/. I then have 8 corners / connectable pairs to your 5, but 
 you have strong horizontal and vertical line possibilities, and an 
 L threat. Overall, I probably have a small advantage, but it is 
 fairly even. I suspect I may also have something across the bottom,
 but I'm not sure without spending a lot more time looking.
>>After 27 H5\\ C11\\ B10/ you threaten:
@7/ B10/ B11/ any  win

    B9/  D12/ C11+ B11/ any win
              C12/ B12+ any win
thus my thought of F12+ G11\\ I7+. After this your suggestions 
 combined: A7/ B9/ H10+ leaves you with a strong position I believe. 
 I can't see a way to immediately force a win for you, but you 
 certainly will be the one threatening.<<]

;C[I link up, getting a connectable pair in the process. I threaten with
B1+ any D0/ any F0/ any C1\\ any win.]
P0[move E 3 +]
;C[The expected defence. Kills the connectable pair and sets up a 
 threat:
B2\\ A2\\ A1\\ any win
    A3+ C1+ any A2\\ any win]
P1[move E 0 /]
;C[Evens up the balance of corners again. The game is pretty even- if 
 anything you have the advantage since it is your turn.
>>I can't really tell. It seemed rather difficult for me to find a 
 very useful move at this point.<<]
P0[move E 0 /]
;C[Turns back my growing vertical line, and sets up strong hints of a 
 horizontal line.
>>This also leaves you with a very strong position on top and a 
 useful corner.  I am not sure if the fact that your line threat is 
 stopped for some time compensates.<<]
P1[move D 6 +]
;C[I prevent your horizontal line from being a threat for quite a few 
 turns yet. In turning it towards my corner, I also delay any 
 vertical line attempt you might make. This also sets up a 9 stage 
 threat:
G5\\ F6+ F7\\ any win
    G6\\ F7\\ C8/ B8/ any win
            D8/ G8\\ any win
            D8\\ D9\\ any B9/ any win

(1) F11+ H11\\ any B9/ any win
    G11+ E11/ any B9/ any win
    any B9/ any win]
P0[move C 7 /]
;C[Your expected defence, even if you didn't see the threat. Gives you 
 an L (G6\\ any win) and just about any defence I make gives you a 
 connectable pair. Note that if you had killed the other corner with 
 C8/, I would have won with a 4 stage:
G5\\ F6+ F7\\ any B8/ any win
    G6\\ G7+ any B8/ any win]
P1[move G 4 +]
;C[I decide killing the L is the safest move, even if it does give you a 
 connectable pair. I am a little wary of the possibilities you may 
 have of using my corner at C7 to form a cave.]
P0[move F 6 +]
;C[I needn't have worried. You decide to go for the more immediate pair 
 L (D8\\ any win), killing my corner.]
P1[move C 8 /]
;C[I split your connectable pair and replace your L with one of my own 
 (H6\\ any win).]
P0[move H 4 /]
;C[One of the two safe moves here (the other being I4+). Linking up with 
 H5+ is only asking for trouble from F7\\ forming 2 Ls and an edge. 
 Note that I would need to prevent losing to your line (F1/ any win) 
 by playing D1\\ first.
>>This is when I first realized that I was in some trouble. In 
 addition to having a good position on top, you now also have an 
 advantage on the bottom.<<]
P1[move I 4 /]
;C[Kills an important corner for you, and slows down both vertical line 
 prospects (on the left and on the right). It does bring your 
 horizontal line possibility back into play though, but it is far 
 enough away not to worry about it at this stage. I also set up a 
 threat:
D9\\ D10\\ G10\\ any win
    any  G9+ any win]
P0[move C 9 /]
;C[Kills the 3 stage. However, it sets up a 10 stage threat for me. I 
 was expecting something more like D7+, but that also loses. G7+ and 
 H6+ appear to be the only safe moves here.]
P1[move D 9 /]
;C[I go onto the attack. I had been looking at the potential threat in 
 the top left corner for several turns, but you always had one line 
 of defence that let you out. When you played move20, I found a way 
 through.]
P0[move A 4 +]
;C[The better of your two replies. If you had played B3\\ I would have 
 played @4/ getting a pair of back to back Ls. Although this is 
 passive, you have no defence and would quickly exhaust your corners 
 before losing the initiative.]
P1[move A 3 \\]

P1[move A 3 /]
;C[I turn my only path back into a corner and strengthen its line 
 potential in case you turn it back up.]
P0[move B 3 +]
;C[An eminently logical move. You kill my corner, create a new one for 
 yourself and extend your line. One might reasonably question my 
 strategy at this point as you have four corners to my zero and a 
 length three line to my length two. In my favour is the fact that 
 you have five paths to my one, which may be a large enough 
 difference for it to favour the side with the fewer paths. Also I 
 have a chance to get a slight aspect ratio advantage. I am not sure 
 that these last two points really counterbalances your advantages, 
 but it is close enough to make it interesting.]
P1[move @ 2 +]
;C[One nice thing about this position for me is that it is easy to kill 
 your corners and create a few for me. I also extend the potential 
 for my line.]
P0[move B 0 /]
;C[You extend your line.]
P1[move D 3 +]
;C[I likewise extend mine creating a corner for myself in the process. I 
 now have things set up so that if you extend your line to the left,
 I have it stopped on both sides by connectable pair L threats.]
P0[move A 5 \\]
;C[You turn my line toward your corner, weakening the former and 
 strengthening the latter. You also give yourself another corner and 
 threaten with a 4-stage.]
P1[move B 6 \\]
;C[This avoids your 4-stage and threatens to get my line moving again.]
P0[move C 6 +]
;C[You kill my line completely, making a corner and two connectable 
 pairs for you. In compensation, my position on top is strengthened 
 somewhat as you cannot kill off either of my corners up there 
 without giving me a reasonably dangerous connectable pair. An 
 alternative here might be @3+, extending your line and setting up 
 another way to turn my line back.]
P1[move D 5 +]
;C[I break up one of your connectable pairs, create a corner, strengthen 
 another, and set up to turn back your lines.]
P0[move @ 4 /]
;C[You kill the corner and set up to kill the one just below it. You 
 allow me to turn back your lines however.
>>In hindsight, this is probably not a particularly good move. I 
 could not see my line getting home, so I moved from the attack to 
 the defence (giving up on my line). However, it leaves me with very 
 little else.<<
I believe H4+ is correct here as this also improves your connectable 
 pair. You won't get either line home real soon, but they do make it 
 hard for me to do much.]
P1[move @ 4 /]
;C[So I connect your lines together, and your position on the left is 
 improved slightly similarly to the way mine was on top.]
P0[move G 3 \\]
;C[You recap my the corners I made last move, threatening with an L.
>>This move is pretty pointless. You play the obvious move and I am 
 in trouble with your line again.<<]
P1[move H 3 \\]

 4-stage on the top right.
F1/ F0/ I6\\ any I1/ any win
    any I6\\ any I2+ any win
I now have an aspect ratio advantage as the vertical length is only 6 
 (length 6 or 7 is optimal) whereas the horizontal length is 8, the 
 point at which greater length is not advantageous to the player 
 whose lines tend to be along that axis.]
P0[move G 6 +]
;C[You defend the threat, getting an L in the process.]
P1[move I 4 +]
;C[I defend the only way I can.  I am forced to give you a connectable 
 pair.]
P0[move H 6 +]
;C[You kill my corner and make it very difficult for me to do much of 
 anything over on the left.]
P1[move B 5 +]
;C[I kill your connectable pair, setting up threats on the right.]
P0[move J 5 \\]
;C[You defend by killing my new corner. I cannot rekill your corner 
 without allowing you to reform the connectable pair.]
P1[move K 5 \\]
;C[This move gets my line and loop threats going for real.]
P0[move I 3 +]
;C[This defends most of the threats by allowing you to get a vertical 
 line at many key points.  However you do leave me with a 4-stage. I 
 don't know what the correct defence is for you.
>>None at this stage.<<]
P1[move E 7 +]
;C[I actually didn't see this 4-stage when I played 23 I3+. It took some 
 time analysing the position after 24 E7+ for me to find it, as it is 
 the type of move I tend to overlook.  I now understand why you 
 didn't like 23 I3+ at all.
>>I didn't actually see this threat until you made the attack. I 
 guess all this means that my move 22 (K5\\) was faulty. I was 
 thinking of playing H7\\ but didn't like extending that edge out.<<
Yes, I can play G7+, and keep some advantage, but I don't have any 
 clear way to win against H7\\.]

 reasonable vertical lines and you have a horizontal line across 
 the bottom. I have a couple more corners, but you have two 
 connectable pairs, and the initiative.]

;C[This kills the first two, but leaves me with the third. You had to go 
 onto the attack, but I don't see anything useful for you. Move 29 
 F0\\ would have prevented me from forming the third threat and still 
 defends the L for you. However, I can cause problems with:
29 F0\\ I4+ G3+ D2+ any B1\\ any win

                   E0/ will kill only 3 of them.

(F0+ any D0\\ any A1\\ any win) and an edge (G5\\ any G1+ any win)]

;C[This corner here is the critical one for black. Unfortunately it 
 cannot be destroyed easily by white. This temporarily destroys the 
 edge and lengthens the vertical white line on the right. However, 
 black still has the line win with:
D0\\ any A1\\ any win]
P0[move F 0 /]
;C[The obvious move here - stops the white line and creates an L to 
 replace the edge (G6\\). Black still has the line threat.]
P1[move G 3 +]
;C[A dangerous move. Leaves the L undefended and allows black to create 
 a second, independent loop threat with:
@3/ *** C1+ any A2\\ any win
        H6\\ any win
    G0+ H1/ any H7\\ any win

                I6\\ any win
            H0+ I1/ any I7\\ any win
As you can see, white cannot kill both threats before black wins with 
 one of them. However white had to attack, and this was the only area 
 of the board that he could without losing the initiative.]
P0[move A 7 /]
;C[Without seeing the win above, this is a safe alternative - it defends 
 the attack and line. Black still has the L and line win.]
P1[move @ 5 +]
;C[Defends the L. The white line across the bottom is 2 away. However, 
 it also leaves black a second line win possibility, this time 
 horizontally:
F7\\ F8\\ I8+ any I3D J5+ J7\\ any D1+ any A2\\ any win
                    J6+ J4/ any D1+ any A2\\ any win
                    any D1+ any A2\\ any win
    E8+ @4\\ any I8\\ any win
    any B1+ any win
Slightly better defences for white may have been I4+ or I4/, although 
 these leave the vertical line win.]
P0[move H 5 +]
;C[Black is going for the horizontal line. This move is counter- 
 attackable with white retaining the initiative. The F7\\ would have 
 been better first. If white counterattacks with a horizontal line, 
 extending the playing area with @4\\ will regain the initiative, 
 leaving a win with the L at I8\\.]
P1[move B 1 +]
;C[The correct counter-attack as this allows the playing area to be 
 extended slowing down the black line. White also has an L sitting 
 over Black with B1/.]
P0[move G 0 +]
;C[The counter-attack is therefore necessary to prevent losing the 
 initiative.]
P1[move H 1 /]
;C[Creates 2 further threats: an edge (E0\\ or H0/) although this is 
 counter-attackable at both ends, and a short edge: J3\\ any J1/ any 
 win. The extension of the playing area prevents black from forcing 
 the line home.]
P0[move I 2 /]
;C[This move is necessary to start killing the white 
 threats. Note that capping off the edge kills the 3 threats but 
 leaves another one:
if 22 F0/, H0+ I2/ J5\\ any J2/ any win
               I1/ J5\\ any J1+ any win]
P1[move D 1 +]
;C[However white can just reform a second threat:
B1\\ any win
H1/ any win
J4\\ any J2/ any win
White had to make this defence anyway - anything else leaves a black 
 threat.]
P0[move C 0 /]
;C[This attack just replaces one L with another (A2\\) One way of killing 
 all white threats was A3\\ followed by K3/.]
P1[move A 5 \\]
;C[White must play either this or @5+ since anything else creates the L 
 F9+. @5+ would have been the stronger of the two since black could 
 not then reform the attack while killing the L at A2\\.]
P0[move @ 6 +]
;C[Kills the two Ls, but leaves a short edge for white at K5\\ any K3/ 
 any win. Blacks only real alternative was to continue attacking with 
 @4+.]

;C[White obviously didn't see the short edge, and lets black off the 
 hook.]
P0[move I 2 /]

    any J9+ any J8\\ any win

P0[move M 3 +]

 However, it is not very effective at this.]
P1[move J 1 /]
;C[Defends the attack and makes an L (M1+).]
P0[move I 0 +]

 defends the L and slows down the horizontal white line threat.]
P1[move N 2 /]
;C[Counter-attacks.]
P0[move L 1 +]
;C[This defence presents white with an interesting possibility: J0\\ 
 would create an L (H1\\) and a line threat (K1/ any C5\\ any win). 
 Black has no material in the right places to kill both, or attack 
 white messing up the line. If black caps off, white just caps off 
 again.
Either J0+ or K0+ would have been better for black here.]
P1[move J 0 \\]
;C[White goes for the line directly. Black has enough corners in the 
 right places to keep white 2 away for this. Even worse, if black 
 plays right, he can force a win.]
P0[move C 4 \\]
;C[Counter-attack. This also gives black an L (A3\\) although to use it, 
 he needs to get the white line out of the way first (eg with N6/).]
P1[move C 3 \\]
;C[Kills the L and creates a cave threat:
E1/ any win
However, this move is faulty since Black can win
with: N6/ O6/ A6+ any H12\\ any K8\\ any win
          any N7\\ any win
The alternatives for white though aren't any better.]
P0[move B 2 /]
;C[This move is an alternative to the N6/ for slowing the line down.]
P1[move L 1 /]
;C[Defends and creates an L. L0/ would have been much stronger (in case 
 black isn't working on the cave threat) since the L created by that 
 move is independent and the line is also closer.]
P0[move I 0 /]
;C[This move is faulty on a couple of counts. It doesn't use the black 
 threat to win (A7+ any H13\\ any K9\\ any win). It doesn't defend the 
 white cave(E3/ any win). It creates another threat for white
G4\\ G3\\ G0+ F2\\ E2\\ any win

 your horizontal line in my way and I couldn't work around it. I 
 didn't want to risk it so I played this move instead. This move

 it home with G7\\. I have shortened your extended edge threat, but

 have time to worry about your line later.]

 will end up extending your line for you. The disadvantage for you

 line is stronger. I can attack with G4\\ to link up my line making it 
 6 long. ie I have a line threat: G4\\ any D0+ any win. I also have an 
 extended edge threat in the bottom left corner:
E7\\ any @3+ any C7+ any A7/ any win]

 the left, but my defence will also extend my line. Although you have 
 the initiative, my line is stronger, and I can stop yours more 
 easily. A better aggressive move would have been F1R linking your 
 line (this also makes it easier for you to turn my line back, and 
 your line prevents me from using my threat in the bottom left).]
P1[move @ 5 /]
;C[My best defence. I cannot defend to the right because that would give 
 you an edge threat on the left. This move gives me a strong corner 
 at A6. Should you decide to link up your line with C2+, I can attack 
 here and go on with my win.]

 have left is the cave threat on the bottom. If you activate that 
 (J9R) I counter-attack, regain the initiative an win. Basically, the 
 situation is reversed from what it was before. You have the 
 initiative, and I have multiple threats. I do not believe that you 
 can prevent my eventual win in this position.

 edge) but you do not have any threats that I can see you using 
 easily. This would have been your best line of continuation.]

 doesn't give you any more corners, and makes my corner at A2 
 stronger (since it is now facing into a hollow). Something like C1\\

;C[This move is quite safe.]
P1[move B 0 /]
;C[I create an L threat: A1\\ any win]
P0[move B 0 /]
;C[This move kills the corner at the base of the L, successfully 
 defending it. Another good move would be A2+, linking the two

 it without giving me an attack. This also sets up a threat for me:

            E2/ F2/ any F4\\ any win]

 this direction. This move also defends my threat.]

 my vertical line very strong. I also have lots of corners which 
 places me in quite a good position.]

P0[move A 3 \\]
;C[This is your only safe move. Everything else would leave my threat.]
P1[move @ 2 /]
;C[I cap off your corners creating another couple of threats:
A1\\ any win
B5/ any B1+ any win]
P0[move @ 2 /]
;C[Both threats have the corner at E1 in common, so killing that corner 
 will defend against both threats.
This move is also the start of turning my line back. However, it 
 gives me other possibilities: If I play D2+, I get 2 L threats: A1+ 
 and A5/. Unfortunately, this also give you an L (H2/) so I can't 
 play it like that. The alternative is to attack all the way, with 
 A5/ first, followed by E2+, leaving me with the L. However if you 
 defend the A5/ with @5/ you get a counter attack to my E2+, and I 
 lose the initiative.]
P1[move E 0 /]
;C[To prevent you from making your counter-attack, I play this move 

 first. It extends my right hand line, and creates another L threat 
 (G7\\ any win). It also makes your counter-attack to my other threat 
 faulty. Therefore I have 2 (independent) threats. You need to defend 
 the threat on the left while attacking before defending the L on the 
 right. The only move you had available for this was D1\\. I may have 
 said that you had only one safe move - this was it. However, looking 
 at it again, I can still win from this by defending with E0/. This 
 gives me a line attack, and I still have the L down the bottom.]
P0[move E 7 +]
;C[This defends the L, but allows me to win with the line(G8+ any win). 
 A better move would have been G6+. That way if I persist with the 
 line, you have somewhere to turn it back.
My threat on the left is still there:
A5/ any D2+ any win with the new L in the top left.]

 line attack at the top. You cannot defend both.]

 demonstrates the delicate balance in Trax between loops and lines.

 to defend both. To destroy both, you need to keep attack while 
 destroying the first threat, and then use the initiative to destroy

 this move (defending one threat) is a reasonable move.]

 an edge on the right. If to the right, it creates the cave on the

;C[Kills the upper-left white corner and gives also black a connectable 
 pair. However both whites and blacks connectable pair could have 
 been better if there was tile between the ends that are connectable 
 in one of both ends.]
P1[move B 1 +]
;C[good move. It extends the playing area vertical which makes the black 
 potential vertical line weaker. Also kills a black corner and 
 creates a hollow for the white connectable pair which makes the pair 
 a lot stronger.]
P0[move C 5 /]
;C[Destroys the white connectable pair. Makes some corners. Also creates 
 the possibility of a future back-to-back L at the top.]
P1[move D 1 \\]
;C[Kills two black corners and the possibility of a black back-to-back 
 L.]
P0[move E 1 \\]
;C[With this move black threats to play D4+ creating a L- and a edge-
 threat and one threat at the bottom. The bottom threat would be
@5/ B6/ B7/ any E7\\ any win or
@5/ A6/ E7\\ any A7+ any win
The only way to kill these three threats is E5+ but this creates a 
 little more complex bottom threat for white.
@5/ A6/ A7/ any G1/ any F8+ any G6+ any win
But actually this played move is not good for black because it gives 
 white a very good corner at C0. A good corner because white can now 
 with A4/ extend the line ending at A3 while creating an L threat. 
 This moves also makes the white corner former at E0 a little 
 stronger by transforming it to a 2x2 corner.
I think that 12 D0+ is the best. It kills an important white corner, 
 extends the black line, creates a hollow for the black connectable 
 pair.]

 tile and creates a good white connectable pair.]

With this move black makes a edge-threat(A0/ any E1/ any win) and 
 
 destroys the white corner so white can't now extends the line and 
 makes a L in the same move.]
P1[move A 1 +]

 have a line threat with @4/ any wins (B6\\) and a cave threat at the

 reasons: First, G1+ Straightens the line again, and it is now longer

The best move here is B0\\ to go for the win described above. If you 
 wanted to concentrate on defending the line, the best move is 
 probably E0/, linking the 2corners. The parallel segment can be used 
 later to turn the line back if necessary, and this move also creates 
 2 threats for White: D1\\ any win, and G1/ any G5\\ any win.]

P1[move A 0 \\]
;C[At this level of play, this is a good move - it creates a white 
 threat (@1\\ any E3\\ any E3/ any win) and gets a couple of corners, 
 it also creates a complex advanced threat for Black. Black can win 
 with: B3\\ using the connectable pair just created. If White defends 
 to the left, it creates an edge threat on the right. White must 
 therefore defend with C0/ or D0+. If 7 C0/, Black can create 2 
 threats with C0+ D1/ E2/. While white has plenty of corners, these 2 
 threats cannot both be defended. If 7 D0+, Black can again create 2 
 threats with B0/, and force a win with one of those. This type of 
 advanced threat is caused passive because Black actually 
 relinquishes the initiative to White, and must regain it again to 
 complete the win. Being an advanced type of threat you are not 
 expected to be able to recognise it at this level. (Actually, many 
 of the top ranked players wouldn't recognise it either!)]
P0[move D 1 \\]

 line, with little in the way of defending it. Something like @1/ is 
 much safer, and also gives you an additional corner.]
P1[move C 0 +]
;C[The move for White to play here is @2+ or E2+. These extend the line, 
 while creating an edge threat. The move you have made is still very 
 good, although more defensive. It defends the potentially dangerous 
 connectable pair, gives you an L threat (D4\\) and a useful corner at 
 A4 for extending your line.]
P0[move B 4 /]
;C[A good defence. It kills the L, and removes the corner at A4. It also 
 threatens to link up one of the 2 potential vertical lines.]
P1[move B 5 /]
;C[Extends the white line on the left to prevent it from being turned 
 back. Actually it was in little danger of being turned back since 
 @3+ would allow you to create an attack and edge with F2\\. This move 
 is still aggressive.]
P0[move @ 5 +]
;C[If you are going for a line race, White would win. This strengthens 
 your line, which is in no danger of being turned back because of 
 your key corners at A2 and E4. You cannot turn the white line back 
 for similar reasons. This move creates an edge threat (F1/ any F5\\ 
 any win) which only just has enough space before the white line 
 causes problems.]
P1[move D 4 +]
;C[A reasonable move on the surface which does at least 3 things:
1) Kills a useful corner for Black, allowing you to start defending 
 the line.
2) Creates an L threat for you (F5\\ any win)
3) Brings another horizontal line into play.
However, it allows Black to gain the advantage with the line (see 
 comment for next turn). F2+ would have been better since it keeps 
 your line advantage, and gives you an edge threat across the top 
 which keeps Black out of your way. Black can do little to prevent 
 you from getting the line home.]
P0[move F 3 +]
;C[Extending the line gains you the advantage in a line race. In fact 
 there is little that White can do now to stop your line.]
P1[move C 6 +]

 the length of Black's, and it is now Black's turn. Black can win 
 with A7/. About the only move you have available is B0\\ A1\\ @4+ 
 which may let you block the line at the top.]
P0[move A 6 /]
;C[This is the wrong end of the line to extend. You don't need to worry 
 about being turned back at the top since D0\\ gives you an L threat, 
 and D0/ doesn't defend the line. Playing A7/ gives you a double loop 
 / line attack]
P1[move D 0 +]
;C[This is your only defence available.]

 a white L in the top left corner.
Most of your alternative moves leave you in trouble with the White 

 line. @8+ may be better since you can then turn back the white line, 
 and it also attacks with your line.]

 sequence @6\\, this move is quite reasonable.]

 down side is that it also messes up your own line possibilities. All 
 lines going into the dead cave are also useless because they cannot

 force a win from this point.]

 actually links the two together to create a new combined threat:

 prevents you from using the threat on the left.]

;C[You counter-attack to retain the initiative. This is your only move 
 to play here.]

P0[move A 4 +]

 doesn't help because White has corners on the bottom to bring it 
 back out again. Your best move here was H2\\, turning the line back 
 into the cave.]

P0[move E 9 \\]
;C[Commits the black line to going vertically. Doesn't defend the white

 also gives a corner to help your line (either horizontally or 
 vertically).]
P1[move C 9 +]
;C[Right area, but the wrong move. I4/ would give you an edge on the top 
 (after black defends). You are going for your vertical line, but the 
 sequence leaves you just as far from the edge as before this move]

 the top half and one on the bottom half.]

;C[Slows the top line of white. Also makes a vertical black line attack.]
P1[move G 1 +]

 can defend by extending the playing area (top or bottom) or by 
 separating the line in the middle (eg H8\\).]
P0[move G 9 \\]
;C[Eh? H7\\ links the line to win!]
P1[move J 3 /]
;C[Defends the L but not the line attack. You needed to play H0\\ or H0+ 
 to defend both, or to attack.]
P0[move I 1 +]
;C[This slows down the white line by giving it further to go, but you 
 are forgetting your own line.]
P1[move K 3 +]

 black (L5\\), it would be great.]
P0[move H 1 1 +]

 the loop would have been better.]
P1[move M 8 +]

 the line is now undefendable without giving a loop threat somewhere]

 my parallel line with an attack (A1\\) which when I defend, you then 
 turn back the line. ie

This move though is not without its merits.]

 also setting a trap for you because I get the last counter-attack if 
 you try to use your threat at the top.]

P1[move A 3 /]
;C[Makes another connectable pair for yourself]
P0[move A 4 +]
;C[which I split and make my position stronger. The corners at B1, A4, 
 and C3-B5 are all strong because they are beside hollows. That means 
 that if I make an attack with this corners into the hollow, your 
 defence options will be limited by those hollows. Because of that, I 
 have 2 quite complex threats here:
B5\\ C5\\ C6\\ any A6/ any win
    C4\\ D4\\ C5\\ C6\\ any A6/ any win
            D5\\ E5\\ any E1/ any win
B0\\ A1\\ A0\\ any D1/ any win 
    A2+ @2\\ B1\\ B0\\ any D1/ any win
            A1\\ @1\\ A0\\ E1/ any win
                    B0\\ E1/ any win
                    B0/ B0/ any @4/ any A1\\ any win
                    C0/ F3/ E2+ E1/ any win
                            F2/ E2/ anyL F1/ any win
                                    anyR @4/ any A1\\ any win
                    D0+ E1/ F1/ E0\\ A1+ F0/ any @5/ any (1)
                                    B1\\ F0/ any B1+ any win
                                    C1\\ F0/ any C1\\ any win
                            any B0/ any @4/ any A1\\ any win
(1) D1\\ E0+ G1/ any A4\\ any win
        F0+ D1\\ any A4\\ any win
        any A3\\ any win
Now I don't expect you to see all of that at this stage, but the key 
 point is that when there is a corner into a hollow, and another 
 corner on the other side if it there is the possibility of 
 eventually setting up an L threat because of the limited defence 
 possibilities.]
P1[move @ 2 +]
;C[This is a good move here! It actually destroys both of the above 
 threats - the first by killing the corner, and the second by 
 changing the hollow and weakening it.
This move also goes towards evening up the corner balance by giving 
 you 2 corners.]
P0[move @ 3 \\]
;C[I cap off your corners, and create an L threat in the process:
A1\\ any win]
P1[move @ 3 \\]
;C[You cap off again.]
P0[move @ 3 \\]
;C[This move does several things. First it links up my horizontal line, 
 making it quite strong. Second, it creates an edge threat on the 
 bottom: E5\\ any A5/ any win. Third, it creates an extended edge 
 threat on the left: B1+ any @5/ any A2\\ any win.
You must either attack (nothing useful here to attack and defend the 
 threats with) or kill the corner common to both threats (A4).]
P1[move C 4 +]
;C[You chose the latter.]
P0[move @ 4 \\]
;C[I decided to push my line, and test out your line defences.]
P1[move B 1 +]
;C[You were so busy trying to defend my line, that you forgot my attack. 
 For defending the line, this move is also relatively ineffective 
 because I can just straighten out my line again.
A better move is F0/ which defends the attack and then threatens to 
 turn my line back with H2\\ or H1/ to extend the top path out further 
 than my line (effectively blocking it).]
P0[move H 2 /]
;C[I close my loop to win.]
