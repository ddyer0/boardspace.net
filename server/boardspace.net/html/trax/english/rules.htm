<h2>Definitions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>TRAX is played with identical square tiles on which
sections of red and white track join adjacent edges on one side and
opposite edges on the other side.</li>
<li>Two players determine by prior agreement who shall be
represented by each coloured track.</li>
<li>The game is won by the player whose track forms a loop or a
line:<br />
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>during that player's completed turn or</li>
<li>during an opponent's completed turn in which the
opponent's track does not also form a loop or a line.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A loop is a continuous path of track that connects with
itself.<br />
<div class="figure"><img src="rules_files/17.gif" alt="A white loop" height="108" width="152" /></div>
</li>
<li>A line is a continuous path of track that connects opposite
and outermost edges of the tiles in play, over at least 8 rows of
tiles, across or down.<br />
<div class="figure"><img src="rules_files/19.gif" alt="A white line" height="162" width="372" /></div>

<div class="item"><a name="25"></a>
<div style="float: right;"><a href="#top"><img src="rules_files/c_top.gif" alt="top" /> Top</a></div>
<h2>Rules of play:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Commencing with the White player, each player at each turn
places a tile, either side up, on any flat surface.</li>
<li>After the first turn, each tile must be placed edge to edge
alongside any tile or tiles already in play so as to always join
sections of same coloured track to each other. eg<br />
<div class="figure"><img src="rules_files/23.gif" alt="Moves" height="64" width="155" /></div>
</li>
<li>Each player may join track of either or both colours in any
turn.</li>
<li>Forced plays - If a tile played in any turn forms an
adjacent space or spaces into which same coloured track enters from two
edges, that same player must play a further tile into each such space
so as to join up the same coloured track, be it white or red, as part
of that turn.<br />
A forced play may itself require further forced plays to be made. A
turn is not complete until the only remaining spaces are either single
edged spaces or two edged spaces entered by track of both colours.<br />
In the position here, playing the first tile forces a second, which in
turn forces the third tile. The next space is entered by track of both
colours so turn ends.<br />
<div class="figure"><img src="rules_files/21.gif" alt="Forced plays" height="118" width="196" /></div>
</li>
<li>Illegal turn - If a forced play forms an adjacent space
into which same coloured track enters from more than two edges, that
whole turn is illegal and uncomplete and must be replayed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Limited Tiles Game</h2>
There is a Trax variant game that can be played using a limited number
of tiles (64 at most). The rules are as follows:<br />
<br />
By prior agreement, a version of TRAX may be played which is limited to
8 rows across and down. As these limits are reached, tiles must be
played into remaining spaces until a win is achieved or all tiles that
can be legally played have been played, in which case the game is drawn.</div>
