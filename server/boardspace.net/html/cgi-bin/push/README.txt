these files are the remains of an attempt to connect a push systemn
called "pushbullet" to boardspace.  It is wiggling, but I think the

Server error, try again later (500 - Can't connect to api.pushbullet.com:443 (certificate verify failed)) at G:\share\projects\boardspace.net\cgi-bin\tournament-signup.cgi line 1936.
