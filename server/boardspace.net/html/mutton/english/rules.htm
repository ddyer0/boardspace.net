<h1 class="western"><em>Introduction</em></h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">All is not well in the
farmyard. The cock crows, the farmer wakes and sees another sheep eaten
in the night. Grabbing his trusty gun he takes careful aim... but at
which blood-spattered suspect? Can he shoot the wolves in sheep's
clothing before they eat all his sheep?</p>
<h2 class="western">Components</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">1 hexagonal game board.</p>
</li>
<li>26 sheep, labelled 'A' to 'Z'. </li>
<li>Sheep movement tracking sheets.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="western">Goal</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A match is played over two
games. Each game has a Wolf player, who scores 1 point for each dead
sheep, and a Farmer who tries to shoot the wolves hidden amongst the
flock as quickly as possible, thus minimising the Wolf's score.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">After both players have had
a turn at being the Wolf, the player with the highest score wins.</p>
<h2 class="western">Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The Farmer places 26
sheep labelled 'A' to 'Z' on the board.</p>
</li>
<li>The Wolf secretly chooses four of these to be wolves in
sheep's clothing. The Wolf may find it convenient to choose four
letters of a common word (e.g. "EASY") so that the hidden wolves are
easily remembered.
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><img src="rules_files/sample-move-1.jpg" height="290" width="420"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><strong>Figure
1. </strong>&nbsp;A popular starting layout.</p>
<h2 class="western">Play</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Each round consists of a
Wolf move followed by a Farmer move, as follows.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wolf Move</span>: The Wolf
player must kill a sheep adjacent to one of the hidden wolves and
indicate its death by turning the corpse upside down. Each immediate
neighbour of the corpse (including the killer) then runs away to an
empty cell that is not adjacent to the corpse.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><img src="rules_files/sample-move-2b.jpg" height="291" width="420"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><strong>Figure
2. </strong>&nbsp;Wolf D eats M, then all adjacent animals
(including D) move away from the corpse...</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><strong>Figure
3.</strong> &nbsp;... leaving the position shown. D is ready
to kill again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="left"><strong>Farmer
Move: </strong>The Farmer may perform one of the following
actions:</p>
<ul>
<li> Pass (unless the Wolf was forced to pass).</li>
<li> Shoot a suspect, in which case the corpse is turned upside
down (neighbouring sheep do not run away).</li>
<li> Go berserk and shoot multiple suspects. </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If
the Farmer shoots a wolf, the Wolf player confirms the kill
immediately, in the time-honoured fashion: "Aroooo!".&nbsp; If the
Farmer shoots a sheep, the Wolf player should say "Baaa!" as
pathetically as possible.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">If the Farmer goes berserk
and shoots multiple suspects then the game ends, and any surviving wolf
eats the remaining sheep as the Farmer reloads. Multiple shots should
be used as a last resort only!</p>
<h2 class="western">Notation</h2>
<p> The Farmer will find it useful to track sheep movements
resulting from wolf kills on the sheets provided. We suggest that the
Farmer tracks the animals incriminated in each Wolf kill on a separate
row, since this information can be re-visited later in the game when
more suspects are eliminated; animals killed by the farmer can just be
marked off across the top of the sheet, since there is no other
information to be gained. </p>

<strong>Figure 4.</strong> &nbsp;Sample tracking chart.
</p>
<p> In the chart above, the top row shows the sheep letter; dead
sheep are crossed out; dead wolves are ringed. In the row marked 1 we
see that in the first turn, the Wolf player ate V, and S and T ran
away. In row 2, U was killed, and A, E, H, Q, R and S ran away. </p>

</p>
<h2 class="western">End of game</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Each game ends when the
farmer succeeds in killing all the remaining wolves. The Wolf scores 1
pt for each sheep killed (eaten or shot) over the course of the game.
The Wolf's score is noted and the second game started with the Wolf and
Farmer roles reversed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The player with the highest
score over both games wins the overall contest. </p>
<h2 class="western">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong> How many times can I go berserk?</strong>
<br>
Once. After that, you have either caught all the wolves, or the wolves
eat all the remaining sheep while you reload. </p>
<p><strong> Where can sheep run to?</strong> <br>
To any empty cell that is not adjacent to the sheep just killed. Sheep
may jump over obstacles. </p>
<p><strong> Can a wolf eat another wolf? </strong> <br>
Yes. The disguises are very good indeed. </p>
<p><strong> What happens if the Wolf player can’t eat
anything? </strong> <br>
The Wolf player must pass. After the Wolf player passes, the farmer <em>must</em>
shoot something, and in fact will have to continue to do so until he
finds all the wolves. </p>
<h2><em>Strategy tips</em></h2>
<p class="western style1">Wolf</p>
<p>Avoid incriminating your packmates. If you make a kill that
causes several wolves to be moved, you increase the odds that they will
be caught. </p>
<p>A wolf doesn't necessarily want to be surrounded by sheep. He
wants his victim to be surrounded by sheep.</p>
<p>Avoid using all your wolves for as long as possible. The
farmer can't sensibly go berserk if one of your wolves hasn't been
activated yet.</p>
<p>Don't split up a group. If multiple suspects from one kill are
involved in the next kill, that reduces the information available to
the farmer.</p>
<p class="western style1">Farmer</p>
<div>
<p>The farmer has the more difficult job; at the start of the
game, it is very difficult to place the wolves with any degree of
accuracy so his main job is to get the wolf to give him as much
information as possible each turn.&nbsp; Most of the advice below
should be read with this in mind.</p>
<p>The starting position shown in figure 1 is recommended, since
the wolf can move at most 3 suspects after the first kill, compared
with a worst case of 6.</p>
<p>101 uses of a dead sheep. The corpses clutter up the board,
and work to the farmer's advantage. All other things being equal, if
you have an equal choice between several suspects, the best choice is
usually the one that leaves the remaining sheep with the fewest
neighbours. Try to leave the corpses scattered around the board rather
than clumped together.</p>
<p>The wolf wants to move with as many sheep as possible. If a
suspect is relatively isolated, it is unlikely to be a wolf.</p>
<p>"Kill them all, and let god work it out." If you are playing
second, and have narrowed down the suspects to one or two candidates
for each wolf, consider going berserk ­ you may have a guaranteed
win.&nbsp; Going first, the decision is more difficult.&nbsp;
In terms of ESD (expected sheep deaths), there is no difference between
going berserk and sniping, as long as all the suspects stick
together.&nbsp; If the suspects are forced to split up, then
sniping is better.&nbsp; Of course, this ignores the psychological
element.</p>
<p>Study your opponent; do they always move the wolf first? Last?
Do they always place the wolf near the maximum number of sheep, or do
they like to be sneaky? Many are the ways in which a wolf can betray
itself.</p>
<p>The Wolf maximises confusion by killing sheep surrounded on
all six sides. It can therefore be good practice to shoot any sheep
thus surrounded even if there's no evidence that it is in fact a wolf;
this will likely hamper the Wolf's next move.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="western">Variants</h2>
<p><strong>Shotgun: </strong>Instead of a rifle, the
Farmer has a shotgun. When he shoots, all neighbouring sheep run away,
in just the same manner as the Wolf move. At the end of both the Wolf
move and the Farmer move, any dead sheep are removed from the board.
The shotgun is single-barrel and cannot be shot multiple times per turn.</p>
<p><strong>Dictionary: </strong>All Wolf words must
be legal Scrabble words.</p>
<p><strong>More/Fewer Wolves: </strong>Although we
recommend four wolves, try playing with three or five wolves for a bit
of variety.</p>
<p> <strong>Quick Play: </strong>Play only one
game; the Wolf player wins by scoring 11 or more points, otherwise the
Farmer wins. Alternatively, players may bid to be the Wolf with the
highest bidder having to score that many points to win.</p>
