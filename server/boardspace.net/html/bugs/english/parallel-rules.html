&nbsp;<strong>Set Up:<br></strong><ul><li>A few random categories of bugs are
selected, enough to make a bug deck. &nbsp;All the bug cards from those
categorties are shuffled together to create the bug deck.</li><li>The bonus deck is created using proportional numbers of bonuses for each category of bug.</li><li>Each player gets 1 random low value bug and 1 random bonus card and 100 victory points.</li><li>Board tiles are selected in a propotion appropriate for the habitats of the bugs in play, and arranged randomly to form a board.</li></ul><strong>Rounds:<br></strong>The game is played over a number of rounds. &nbsp; Each round in the game has 3 phases.<br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this phase all players simultaneously and secretly purchase as many bug and bonus cards<br>as they wish to from the set that is offered. &nbsp;There are no restrictions on the number or type you buy.<br>When all players have finished purchasing, the purchases are revealed. &nbsp;Duplicate cards are issued if appropriate.<br>The cheapest cards in the market, and all cards that were purchases by any player, are removed from the market. <br>All the remaining cards are moved down to cheaper positions, and the empty slots are refilled from the decks.<br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Play Or Move Bugs &nbsp;</span>In this phase, players take turns either playing a new bug or moving an already played bug,<br>subject to the placement rules. &nbsp;Newly placed bugs score the point value of the bug. &nbsp;Moved bugs do<br>not score. &nbsp; Bugs may be moved only once per round. &nbsp; When all players have played or moved as many<br> bugs as they wish, the next phase begins.<br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Play Bonuses&nbsp;</span>In this phase, all players can play "cash in" as many bonus cards as they wish. &nbsp;When all<br>players are finished, the next round begins.</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">End of Game:</span><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
