<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Rules for Bugspiel</h2>
<strong>OBJECT OF THE GAME</strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>Score the most points by playing bugs and bonus cards. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>The general flow of the game is that you purchase bug cards and bonus cards from the market, paying with victory points.<br>New cards start at high cost, and become cheaper over time if they are not purchased.<br>The value to play a card is some number of victory points.<br>The value to play a bonus card depends on matching the group and/or habitat of cards in the same uninterrupted line.<br><br><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><strong>Components<br></strong><ul><li>Bug Cards, each card represents a species of invertibrate.&nbsp;</li><li>Bonus cards are associated with 1 or 2&nbsp;groups of species.</li><li>Hexagonal "Terrain" Tiles of &nbsp;4 types: Aquatic, Soil, Grassland or Forest</li><li>Victory Points are the only currency in the game. &nbsp;Buying cards costs victory points,<br>and playing cards gain victory points.</li><li>The market holds some number of bug and bonus cards at increasing prices.</li></ul></td><td style="background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216); text-align: center;"><img style="width: 300px; height: 319px;" alt="bugcard" src="bugcard.jpg"><br></td><td style="background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216); text-align: center;"><img style="width: 300px; height: 300px;" alt="bonus" src="bonus-cards.jpg"><br></td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216); text-align: center;"><img style="width: 250px; height: 250px;" alt="habitat" src="habitats.jpg"><br></td><td style="background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216); text-align: center;"><img style="width: 250px; height: 250px;" alt="tiles" src="tiles.jpg"><br></td><td style="background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216); text-align: center;"><img style="width: 250px; height: 250px;" alt="diet" src="diet.jpg"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<strong>Set Up:<br></strong><ul><li>A few random categories of bugs are
selected, enough to make a bug deck. &nbsp;All the bug cards from those
categorties are shuffled together to create the bug deck.<br></li><li>The bonus deck is created using proportional numbers of bonuses for each category of bug.<br></li><li>Each player gets 1 random low value bug and 1 random bonus card.<br></li><li>Board
tiles are selected in a propotion appropriate for the habitats of the
bugs in the deck, and arranged randomly to form a board.<br></li><li>The
bug market and goal market are filled with random bugs, except that
bugs that are too immediately profitable are shuffled back<br>into the
deck -&nbsp;there are no "no brainer" cards in the initial offering.
&nbsp; Note that in some randomly created decks, the lowest<br>value bug might be 2 or 3 points rather than 1 point.</li></ul></td><td><img style="width: 736px; height: 615px;" alt="main" src="mainboard.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table><strong><br>Turns:<br></strong>The game is played in a number of turns, each turn you can do one of the following&nbsp;things:<br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase A Bug. &nbsp; </span>Select one of the bugs from the market and add it to your hand, subject to a hand limit of 8 bugs<br>After
a bug has been purchased, the cheapest card below the one
purchased is discarded, then new cards are added to fill the market.<br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase A Bonus. &nbsp; </span>Select one of the bonus cards from the market and add it to your hand, subject to a hand limit of 8 bonus cards.<br>After
a bonus has been purchased, the cheapest card below the one
purchased is discarded, then new cards are added to fill the market.<br><br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Play a bug. &nbsp;</span>Play a bug from your hand on a suitable space of the board. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Bugs have to be played in a suitable habitat - Water, Forest, Grassland or Soil. &nbsp;The bug card background are color coded. <br>Some bugs can live in multiple habitat types. &nbsp; There are three identical spaces to place a bug on each tile.<br><span style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 2px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: &quot;Consolas&quot;; font-size: 10pt; white-space: pre;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(212, 212, 212);">GC</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">setFont</span></span></span><br>Non-predator bugs have to be played in a vacant space. &nbsp;Predator bugs have to be played in a space occupied<br>by a herbivore, detritivore, or non-eating bug. &nbsp; Predators and Parasites are immune to predation.<br><br>When you play a or move a bug, you can also re-orient the tile, breaking up old lines and creating new lines.</li></ul><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Move a bug. &nbsp;</span>Move a bug that can fly from one space to another on the board, subject to the placement rules.<br>Moved bugs don't score again, but flying predators must eat. Vacated spaces can later be re-occupied.<br><br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Play a bonus. &nbsp;</span>Play a bonus card from your hand on one of your bugs on the board. &nbsp;Bonus cards must score<br>for the bug they are placed on, and also score for all bugs in an unbroken line of occupied cells that are oriented<br>in the same direction. &nbsp;Wildcard bugs score only if some non-wild bug is scoring. &nbsp;<br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Very important! &nbsp;</span>all matching bugs for all players in the line score for their players.<br><br><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus Scoring Example</span></h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Green </span>scores
for 2 bees plus their wild card. &nbsp; The green barklouse doesn't
score because it is oriented differently. &nbsp;Since green has no
matches for barklice, the green wildcard is not scored a second time.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br>Yellow </span>wildcard does not score, because there are no other yellow bugs that score.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Blue </span>barklouse scores because it matches the bonus.</td><td><img style="width: 509px; height: 342px;" alt="bonus" src="bonus-scoring.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pass. </span>Do
nothing and let the next player play. &nbsp;You will be able to play
again next turn, except if all players pass sequentially the game ends
with the current score.</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">End of Game:</span><br>The game ends when everyone passes sequentially, or when there are vacant slots in the bug or bonus market,<br>or when a the winning score is reached.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Intended Strategy Considerations<br></span><ul><li>There are 4 types of &nbsp;counter-play against your opponents<br><ul><li>orient the line directions to prevent formation of long lines</li><li>place your own bugs in the same line, so you score when they score.</li><li>use predator bugs to eliminate the opposition. &nbsp;Predators that can fly are especially dangerous.</li><li>buy the bugs and/or bonus cards that they would want to play</li></ul></li><li>When to cash in a bonus is matter of judgement. &nbsp;The value might increase or decrease later.</li><li>When to buy a bug or bonus as its price declines is also a matter of judgement.</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scientific Accuracy &nbsp; : &nbsp;<a href="../deck/deck.html">the deck</a><br></span>The strict accuracy of the information implied by the card is desired, but not guaranteed. &nbsp;Starting with the<br>scientific name (Genus, species), ChatGPT, Google search, and other AI assistants were used to find the<br>common names, place the species in the proper place in the scientific taxonomy, generate the illustrations,<br>the descriptions, the acceptable habitats and so on. &nbsp; &nbsp;All of this information was curated &nbsp;and corrected <br>with ordinary scientific knowlege and human intellegence. &nbsp; I was unable to locate an entomologist who <br>wanted to spend hundreds of hours on a free project.&nbsp; There are a lot of gray areas, but if you spot <br>something that's obviously incorrect, please send suggestions to bugspiel@boardspace.net.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Design Notes:<br></span><br>As noted elsewhere, this game is inspired by Wingspan; but I wanted to make a game with a lot<br>more player interaction. &nbsp;Consequently, there are no secret goals, no hidden information, and<br>plenty of opportunity to play to thwart your opponents as well as build your own engine.<br><br>Also, because this is intended to be a digital-only game, there are features of the game that<br>would be hard to replicate in a physical version. &nbsp;For example, the cards have 4 different<br>syles of presentation, depending on where they are displayed and how large they are. For<br>another, the randomization of the setup is much more detailed than could reasonably be<br>done for a physical game.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">
