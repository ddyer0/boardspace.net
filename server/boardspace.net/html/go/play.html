    <h1 style="text-align: center;">How to Play Go</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">short form, without the irrelevant
      arguments</h3>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <h2>The basics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Go is player on a square grid, with black and white pieces
          which are called stones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Go can be played on any size grid. The standard game uses a
          19x19 board, but smaller boards are used for teaching.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The stones are placed alternately by black and white on
          intersections of the grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Stones the same color which are connected horizontally and
          vertically form a group and are considered together.</li>
        <li>Repeated positions are not allowed, but other than that you
          can play anywhere.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Any group which is completely surrounded is captured.</li>
        <li>Whichever color owns more of the board at the end of the
          game wins.</li>
        <li>The game ends when neither player wants to make another
          move.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These minimal rules don't help at all to understand how to play
        - all the interesting strategy and tactics, as well as all the
        arcane arguments about the rules, scoring, and treatment of
        particular positions emerge from the simple rules, and for the
        most part are irrelevant to non-expert players.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        best way to understand how to play and how a game develops is to
        start at the end.&nbsp; <br>

              <p style="text-align: left;">Here is a completely finished
                game.&nbsp; Black owns all the points that are occupied
                by black stones, or completely surrounded only by black
                stones.&nbsp; White owns all the points that are
                occupied by white stones, or are completely surrounded
                by white stones.<br>
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Final score: Black 46&nbsp;
                White 35&nbsp; - black has won by 9 points.<br>

                here.</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Go players don't usually play
                all the way to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">completely
                  resolved</span> state you see above.&nbsp; Just as
                chess players will say "mate in 2", nod at each other,
                and quit, experienced Go players know when the final
                score is completely determined, and stop play at that
                point.&nbsp; <br>
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Experienced players will
                know, and agree, that the white stone at B6 can't avoid
                being captured, and that the empty point at A1 belongs
                to white.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is any disagreement,
                about this, the players simply resume playing, until
                there is no disagreement.<br>
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;"> There are several methods to
                determine the score from here, which are for all
                practical purposes the same&nbsp; It's the unusual cases
                that cause all the controversy and complications you may
                have heard of.<br>
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">There are only a few of these
                that are likely to occur in ordinary play.<br>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
              <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Seki rule</h2>
              <p>In some situations, black and white are in contact, but
                neither player can capture the other.&nbsp; In these
                situations, all the stones and all the empty
                intersections involved are not counted for either side.<br>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
              <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Ko rule</h2>
              <p>In some situations, black and white can easily capture
                and recapture the same position endlessly.&nbsp; If this
                were allowed, the game would never end, so it's
                forbidden.&nbsp; In actual play, where black or white
                would like to play a forbidden move, he will instead
                make a threatening move somewhere else.</p>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">
              <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Bent Four rule</h2>
              Many pathological situations can be constructed which
              involve capturing and recapturing stones endlessly in ways
              that are more complicated than simple Ko.In practice,
              there is only one of these that is likely to occur in
              actual play, which is known as "bent four in the
              corner".&nbsp; Bent four is dead.&nbsp; There's a good
              explanation for this ruling and it's universally agreed.<br>
