# this script commented out 9/2010 by ddyer. It created /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db
# which is an index used by "locate".  Since I don't use it and I'm the only user,
# this removes both a few gigs of disk space and a huge monthly thrash generating
# the database that no one used.

# commented out rather than removed from cron to avoid resurrectiuon
