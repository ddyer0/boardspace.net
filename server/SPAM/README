SPAM WARS

added to /var/qmail/control, a file called doublebounceto
containing the name of the account that to which "double bounce"
messages are sent.  Must restart mail server to take effect.
this is a standard feature which is not available in the control
panel.

The "spamfilter" file is the one that picks up the catchall address from
the local "catchall" file.

spamfilter has some capability to run a per user mail filtering extension,
but not turned on. possibly this is the hook to spamassin.

I added a second hook to run a .domainmailfilter in the local directory.

spamfilter-orginal is from /home/interworx/lib/maildrop
spamfilter is the one I installed as an alternate

** useful technique: turn on "logfile" in spamfilter file
** and use tail -f to watch messages realtime.

**also use tail -f /var/log/smtp/current to monitor the RBL and incoming mail
**also use tail -f /var/log/send/current to monitor outgoing mail
The actual local filtering implemented by .domainmailfilter is to 
check the delivery address to see if it contains one of the strings
contained in "goodnames.dat".  The effect of this is intended
to allow accepting any email address containing "dyer" as 
a valid catch all, but reject the rest.

/home/realmene/var/real-me.net/mail/badnames.dat

mail deemed acceptable is forwarded to the catchall address.
the filtered mail is either bounced or absorbed depending 
on the content of the domain filter.

detailed behavior of mail delivery is controlled by files in
/home/boardspa/var/boardspace.net/mail/
such as .qmail-bouncedatabase and .qmail-default

     .qmail-default is the file that determines default "catchall" mail delivery.
     it runs a script called /usr/bin/maildrop which uses a file called
     /home/interworks/lib/maildrop/spamfilter to direct delivery.

     .qmail-bounce bounces with "no such mailbox"
     .qmail-blackhole goes to /dev/null

     .qmail-bouncedatabase runs a special filter that tries to note
	bouncing outgoing mail from boardspace.  It looks for a 
	special x-boardspace-user header to identify who the mail
	was intended for.

	maintain the aliases list for boardspace carefully.  Some of the
	addresses directed to bouncedatabase are not obviously needed, but are.

the key directory for mail delivery and spam control is 
~vpopmail/domains/real-me.net/
mailbox "junkmail" is used for a real junk mailbox.

Another anti-spamblock action, much easier than battleing the blockages, is to assign a new IP to use 
for mail sending.  Pick a clean ip address from the pool, and assign it as the outgoing ip using /var/qmail/control/

On two occasions, the catch-all filtering has broken, with the mysterious effect that
only mail directly to ddy@real-me.net gets through.   Most recent incarnation of
a fix/explanaiton:
